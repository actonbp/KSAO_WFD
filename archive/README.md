# Archive Directory

This directory contains archived files from previous versions of the KSAO Workforce Development project. These files are preserved for reference but are no longer actively used in the current version of the project.

## Purpose

The archive serves several purposes:

1. **Preserve History**: Maintain a record of the project's evolution
2. **Prevent Confusion**: Remove outdated files from the main repository structure
3. **Reference Material**: Provide access to previous approaches for reference

## Contents

Files will be moved here during the repository reorganization process if they are:

- Superseded by newer approaches
- No longer relevant to the project's current focus
- Early experimental versions that informed later work
- Documentation of approaches that were tried but ultimately not used

## Using Archived Files

If you need to reference an archived file:

1. Check the file's header comments for information about why it was archived
2. Look for notes about which current files replace its functionality
3. Be aware that archived files may use outdated paths, imports, or approaches

## File Listing

A listing of archived files and their replacement/superseding files will be maintained below as files are moved to the archive:

| Archived File | Replacement/Superseding File | Reason for Archiving |
|---------------|------------------------------|----------------------|
