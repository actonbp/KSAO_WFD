# Archived Directories

This directory contains old directories from the previous repository structure. These have been replaced by the new, more organized structure.

## Moved Directories

| Old Directory | New Location |
|---------------|--------------|
| `images/` | `data/images/` |
| `text_output/` | `data/text_output/` |
| `visualizations/` | `output/visualizations/` |
| `interactive_viz/` | `output/interactive_viz/` |
| `final_viz/` | `output/final_viz/` |
| `academic_viz/` | `output/visualizations/academic/` |
| `creative_viz/` | `output/visualizations/creative/` |
| `optimal_viz/` | `output/visualizations/optimal/` |

## Why These Were Archived

These directories were part of the original repository structure. They have been reorganized to:

1. Create a clearer separation between data, source code, and outputs
2. Make the workflow more logical and maintainable
3. Better support the KSAO extraction and workforce development focus
