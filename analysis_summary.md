## Visual Analysis

The visualizations reveal several key insights:

1. **Word Frequency**: The most common terms across all pages are "substance," "use," "brain," "addiction," "disorder," and "person," highlighting the focus on substance use disorders as brain-based conditions affecting individuals.

2. **Term Distribution**: The heatmap shows how terminology is distributed across pages, with "substance use" appearing consistently throughout the document, while specialized terms cluster on specific pages:
   - Brain-related terms concentrated on pages 7-9
   - Disorder/disease language on pages 4-5
   - Risk factors on page 6

3. **Content Clustering**: The t-SNE visualization shows how pages cluster by topic:
   - Pages 1-3: Introduction and terminology (top right)
   - Pages 4-5: Disease model and brain function (right side)
   - Pages 7-9: Neurobiology and brain systems (left side)
   - Pages 10-11: Substance use patterns and consequences (bottom)

## Summary of Findings

This document presents a comprehensive scientific framework for understanding substance use disorders, progressing from terminology to neurobiology to clinical manifestations.

The text emphasizes:
1. The importance of person-first, non-stigmatizing language
2. The brain disease model of addiction while acknowledging personal factors
3. The neurobiological basis of substance use disorders
4. The continuum of substance use from initial use to disorder
5. The role of risk factors including trauma and developmental influences

This material appears to be from a training or certification manual for addiction counselors, providing scientific foundation for understanding substance use disorders before addressing treatment approaches.
