CHAPTER 1: Scientific Perspectives on Substance Use Disorders and Recovery
23

In short...

» Progression through this cycle involves three major regions of the brain: the basal ganglia, the extended amygdala, and the prefrontal cortex, as well as multiple neurotransmitter systems. The power of addictive substances to produce positive feelings and relieve negative feelings fuels the development of compulsive use of substances.

» The combination of increased incentive salience (binge/intoxication stage), decreased reward sensitivity and increased stress sensitivity (withdrawal/negative affect stage), and compromised executive function (preoccupation/anticipation stage) provides an often overwhelming and unrelenting drive for substance seeking.

Medications used today to reduce cravings and moderate withdrawal symptoms are a result of this research, as well as new technologies that are under investigation (such as transcranial stimulation) that are being used to monitor, optimize, and personalize treatment for SUDs. Understanding the neurobiological actions underlying problematic substance use is important for many reasons.35

1. Treatment Development: Knowledge of how different brain regions and neurotransmitter systems are involved in addiction can lead to the development of targeted treatments. For example, medications that modulate dopamine or other neurotransmitter systems can help manage withdrawal symptoms and reduce cravings.

2. Personalized Medicine: Understanding individual differences in the neurobiology of addiction can lead to personalized treatment plans, optimizing the likelihood of successful recovery for each person.

3. Prevention Strategies: Understanding the neurobiological basis of addiction can help in creating preventive measures, especially for individuals who are at a higher risk. Early intervention can prevent the progression of initial substance use to SUDs.

4. Reducing Stigma: Recognizing addiction as a brain disorder rather than a moral failing can help reduce the stigma associated with it. This can encourage more individuals to seek help and support for their addiction issues.

5. Policy and Education: A deeper understanding of the neurobiological processes can inform public health policies and educational programs, leading to more effective strategies for managing and preventing addiction at the community and population levels.
