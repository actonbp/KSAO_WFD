Over time, the brain of someone who problematically uses substances adjusts by producing fewer
neurotransmitters in the reward circuit, or by reducing the number of receptors that can receive signals. As a
result, the person's ability to experience pleasure from naturally rewarding (i.e., reinforcing) activities is also
reduced.

This is why a person with problematic substance use eventually feels flat, without motivation, lifeless, and/or
depressed, and is unable to enjoy things that were previously pleasurable. Now, the person needs to keep taking
substances to experience even a normal level of reward—which only makes the problem worse, like a vicious
cycle.

Stages and Cycles in the Development of Substance Use Disorders
Substance use disorders are chronic relapsing conditions that evolve through various cycles and a continuum
of stages, each characterized by distinct neurobiological and behavioral changes. Understanding these stages is
crucial for effective treatment interventions.

Historically, there have been differing versions of the stages that lead to SUDs; however, all show similar stages
and associated behaviors. Here are some examples:
» Four stage mode: Use, Misuse, Abuse, Dependency/Addiction
» Five stage model: Experimentation, Regular Use, Risky Use/Abuse, Dependence, Addiction
» Six stage model: Initial use, Abuse, Tolerance, Dependence, Addiction, Relapse

Substance use occurs on a continuum - ranging from no use to beneficial/medicinal use, non-problematic use,
problematic use, harmful use, and substance use disorder. Consider this modern depiction of the continuum.

NO USE
BENEFICIAL USE
NON-PROBLEMATIC USE
PROBLEMATIC USE
POTENTIALLY HARMFUL USE
SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER
Taking a substance for an intended use, such as medicinal
Periodic use without harmful side effects or impacts
Patterns of risky use that threaten a person's health or safety, and the safety of others
Regular patterns of use that are leading to harmful impacts
Uncontrolled use of a substance despite harmful consequences

1. No Use to Beneficial/Medicinal Use: Some individuals never use psychoactive substances, while others
may use them for medicinal purposes without any harmful effects or addiction.

2. Non-problematic Use: This involves using substances in ways that are not risky or harmful. For a
significant number of people, substance use does not lead to addiction or problematic behaviors.

3. Problematic Use: This stage is characterized by a pattern of use that begins to have negative impacts on a
person's life. It includes hazardous or risky use, which can lead to social and personal problems.

4. Harmful Use: This stage involves repetitive substance use that causes physical or psychiatric harm. It is
more severe than problematic use and can lead to significant health and social issues.

5. Substance Use Disorder: This is the most severe stage, where there is a compulsive need to use the
substance despite harmful consequences. It involves a combination of behavioral, cognitive, and
physiological symptoms indicating that an individual continues using the substance despite significant
substance-related problems.
