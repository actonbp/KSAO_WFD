CHAPTER 1: Scientific Perspectives on Substance Use Disorders and Recovery 15

» Problematic substance use is common among individuals exposed to intimate partner violence, including physical, sexual, and psychological violence. Women who have experienced intimate partner violence are at-risk for transitioning from moderate use to SUD and demonstrate greater SUD symptom severity.²²

» In children, the evidence clearly indicates that childhood trauma has profound and long-lasting effects on mental health, emotional development, and the risk of substance abuse. Childhood trauma is a risk factor for a range of psychiatric disorders and adverse outcomes, including impaired social functioning, poor physical health, self-injurious behavior, and addiction.²³

» Trauma is associated with neurobiological dysfunction. Cumulative trauma triggers, aggravates, and increases the recurrence of mental health symptoms and substance use behaviors. This interplay can result in more complex clinical profiles and worse treatment outcomes.²⁴

Addictive Substances, the Brain, and Behavior²⁵,²⁶

To understand how addictive substances affect the brain, it is important to first understand the basic biology of healthy brain function. The brain is an amazingly complex organ that is constantly at work. Within the brain, a mix of chemical and electrical processes controls the body's most basic functions, like breathing and digestion. These processes also control how people react to the multitudes of sounds, smells, and other sensory stimuli around them. They also organize and direct individuals' highest thinking and emotive powers so that they can interact with other people, carry out daily activities, and make complex decisions.

The brain is made of an estimated 86 billion nerve cells—called *neurons*—as well as other cell types. Each neuron has a cell body, an axon, and dendrites. The cell body and its nucleus control the neuron's activities. The axon extends out from the cell body and transmits messages to other neurons. Dendrites branch out from the cell body and receive messages from the axons of other neurons.

Neurons communicate with one another through chemical messengers called *neurotransmitters*. The neurotransmitters cross a tiny gap, or synapse, between neurons and attach to receptors on the receiving neuron. Some neurotransmitters are inhibitory—they make it less likely that the receiving neuron will carry out some action. Others are excitatory, meaning that they stimulate neuronal function, priming it to send signals to other neurons.

The brain is comprised of many parts with *interconnected circuits* that all work together as a team. Different brain circuits are responsible for coordinating and performing specific functions. Networks of neurons send signals back and forth to each other and among different parts of the brain,

Here's how brain cells communicate.
