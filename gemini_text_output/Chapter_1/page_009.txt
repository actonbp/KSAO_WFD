**CHAPTER 1: Scientific Perspectives on Substance Use Disorders and Recovery**

Some drugs like opioids also disrupt other parts of the brain, such as the brain stem, which controls basic functions critical to life, including heart rate, breathing, and sleeping. This interference explains why overdoses can cause depressed breathing and death.

**THE ACTIONS OF NEUROTRANSMITTERS**

Simple activities in everyday life can produce small bursts of neurotransmitters in the brain bringing pleasurable feelings. Substance use can hijack that process.

Pleasure or euphoria—the high from substances—is still poorly understood but involves surges of chemical signaling compounds including the body's natural opioids (endorphins) and other neurotransmitters in parts of the basal ganglia (the reward circuit). When some substances are taken, they can cause surges of these neurotransmitters much greater than the smaller bursts naturally produced in association with healthy rewards like eating, hearing or playing music, creative pursuits, or social interaction.

It was once thought that surges of the neurotransmitter dopamine produced by substances directly caused the euphoria, but scientists now think dopamine has more to do with getting people to repeat pleasurable activities (reinforcement) than with producing pleasure directly.

The feeling of pleasure is how a healthy brain identifies and reinforces beneficial behaviors, such as eating, socializing, and sex. Our brains are wired to increase the odds that we will repeat pleasurable activities. The neurotransmitter dopamine is central to this. Whenever the reward circuit is activated by a healthy, pleasurable experience, a burst of dopamine signals that something important is happening that needs to be remembered. This dopamine signal causes changes in neural connectivity that make it easier to repeat the activity repeatedly without thinking about it, leading to the formation of habits.

Just as substances produce intense euphoria, they also produce much larger surges of dopamine, powerfully reinforcing the connection between consumption of the substance, the resulting pleasure, and all the external cues linked to the experience. Large surges of dopamine "teach" the brain to seek substances at the expense of other, healthier goals and activities.

Cues in a person's daily routine or environment that have become linked with substance use because of changes to the reward circuit can trigger uncontrollable cravings whenever the person is exposed to these cues, even if the substance itself is not available. This learned "reflex" can last a long time, even in people who have not used substances in many years. For example, people who have been living a sober lifestyle for a decade can experience cravings when returning to an old neighborhood or house where they used substances.

**Some drugs target the brain's pleasure center**

*Brain reward (dopamine pathways)*

*These brain circuits are important for natural rewards such as food, music, and sex*


*While eating food* Typically, dopamine increases in response to natural rewards such as food.
*While using cocaine* When cocaine is taken, dopamine increases are exaggerated, and communication is denied.


*How drugs increase dopamine*
*Dopamine Transporter*
*Dopamine Receptor*
*Cocaine*
