stages (i.e., Precontemplation, Contemplation, Preparation, Action, and Maintenance) in the SOC approach in the original TTM.

The associated features of the SOC approach are:

» Precontemplation: People who use substances are not considering change and do not intend to change in the foreseeable future. They may be partly or completely unaware that a problem exists, that they have to make changes, and that they may need help to change. Alternatively, they may be unwilling or too discouraged to change their behavior. Individuals in this stage often are not convinced that their pattern of use is problematic.

» Contemplation: As these individuals become aware that a problem exists, they begin to perceive that there may be cause for concern and reasons to change. Typically, they are ambivalent, simultaneously seeing reasons to change and reasons not to change. Individuals in this stage are still using substances, but they are considering the possibility of stopping or cutting back soon. At this point, they may seek relevant information, reevaluate their substance use behavior, or seek help to support the possibility of changing. They typically weigh the positive and negative aspects of making a change. It is common for individuals to remain in this stage for extended periods, often for years, vacillating between wanting and not wanting to change.

» Preparation: Individuals in this stage start to confront their problem directly. They move beyond mere recognition of their issue and begin to actively seek solutions. With intent on changing, they research treatment options, perhaps engaging with support groups or exploring therapy. Though major changes are not yet made, small steps, like reducing substance use or setting a quit date, signal their commitment to change. Preparation also entails an examination of the individual's self-efficacy or confidence in their ability to change. However, despite this progress, they might still feel ambivalent, wrestling with the decision proceed. This stage is crucial, as it sets the stage for the actual implementation of change in their behavior and lifestyle.
