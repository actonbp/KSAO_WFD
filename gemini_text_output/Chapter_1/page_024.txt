» Action: Here, individuals choose a strategy for change and begin to pursue it. They are actively engaged in changing substance use behaviors. They are making lifestyle changes and may face challenging situations (e.g., temptations to use, physiological effects of withdrawal). They may begin to reevaluate their self-image as they move from problematic substance use to nonuse or safe use. They are committed to the change process and are willing to follow the suggested change strategies.

» Maintenance: This stage entails efforts to sustain gains made during the Action stage and to prevent recurrence. Extra precautions may be necessary to keep from reverting to health-risk behaviors. Individuals learn to identify situations that may trigger a return to substance use and develop coping skills to manage such situations. During Maintenance, individuals are building a new lifestyle that no longer includes the old substance use behaviors.

Most people who have problematic substance use progress through the stages in a circular or spiral pattern, not a linear one. Individuals typically move back and forth between the stages and cycle through the stages at different rates, as shown in the bidirectional arrows in the image. As individuals progress through the stages, they often have setbacks. However, most people do not typically return to the Precontemplation stage to start over again and are unlikely to move from Precontemplation back to Maintenance.

This movement through the stages can vary in relation to different behaviors or treatment goals. For example, a client might be in the Action stage regarding quitting drinking but be in Precontemplation regarding their use of cannabis. Recurrence of problematic substance use is a common part of the process as people cycle through the different stages (note the circular movement in the image).

Although people might return to problematic substance use during any of the stages, a recurrence is most often discussed as a setback during the Maintenance stage. In this model, recurrence is viewed as a normal (not pathological) event because many people cycle through different stages several times before achieving stable change. Recurrence is not considered a failure, but rather a learning opportunity. Each time people have a setback, they are learning from the experience and applying whatever skills or knowledge they have gained to move forward in the process with greater understanding and awareness.

SUMMARY

Scientific breakthroughs have revolutionized the understanding of SUDs. Addiction to substances is recognized as a treatable, chronic medical/brain disease involving complex interactions among brain circuits, genetics, the environment, and an individual's life experiences. There is a progression from non-use to problematic use to SUDs that have a range of behaviors that become compulsive and often continue despite harmful consequences. This progression can be understood within the interplay of distinct neurobiological and behavioral changes. There are many substances that have addictive properties. Knowledge of the signs and symptoms of commonly used substances is fundamental for SUD counselors to effectively assess, treat, and support individuals with problematic substance use or with SUDs.

The definition and hallmarks of recovery have evolved significantly in the last two decades. Recovery from problematic substance use is viewed as a highly personal journey toward wellness, satisfying relationships, engagement in community, and a sense of meaning and purpose. We know that people with problematic substance use benefit from a wide range of support and treatment. Attention to the principles of a recovery-oriented system of care helps to assure that providers of treatment, recovery support, and other services use a long-term, coordinated, and holistic approach to address the clinical, functional, personal, and social aspects of recovery.
