Dependence refers to a physiological and psychological state that develops as a result of repeated substance use.

Craving refers to the intense desire or urge to engage in a particular behavior or consume a substance.

Compulsivity refers to repetitive behaviors in the face of adverse consequences, and repetitive behaviors that are inappropriate to a particular situation.

Withdrawal refers to the physical, cognitive, and affective symptoms that occur after chronic use of a drug is reduced abruptly or stopped among individuals who have developed tolerance to a substance.

The body gets used to a regular supply of the substance and, if the dose is lowered or stopped, a person can experience withdrawal – a set of symptoms which can include negative emotions such as stress, anxiety, or depression, as well as physical effects such as nausea, vomiting, muscle aches, and cramping, among others. Withdrawal symptoms often lead a person to use the substance again.

As use becomes an ingrained behavior, impulsivity shifts to compulsivity. As such, the primary drivers of repeated substance use shift from positive reinforcement (feeling pleasure) to negative reinforcement (feeling relief), as the individual seeks to stop the negative feelings and physical illness that accompany withdrawal. Compulsive behaviors are actions that are engaged in repeatedly and consistently, even though they are experienced as aversive or troubling. Compulsive substance seeking is a key characteristic of an SUD, as is the loss of control over use. Compulsivity helps to explain why many people with an SUD experience a return to regular use after attempting to abstain from or reduce use.

As individuals continue to have problematic use of alcohol, drugs, or other substances, progressive changes, called neuroadaptations, occur in the structure and function of the brain. These neuroadaptations compromise brain function and also drive the transition from controlled, occasional substance use to chronic use, which can be difficult to control. Moreover, these brain changes endure long after an individual stops using substances. They may produce continued, periodic craving for the substance that can lead to relapse – or a recurrence of substance use (a less stigmatizing term) – after an attempt to stop.

Progression to an SUD is not an inevitable consequence of substance use. Whether an individual ever uses alcohol, drugs, or another substance, and whether that initial use progresses to a substance use disorder of any severity, depends on many factors. As previously discussed, these include: a person's genetic makeup and other individual biological factors; the age when use begins; psychological factors related to a person's unique history and personality; and environmental factors, such as the availability of drugs, family and peer dynamics, financial resources, cultural norms, exposure to stress, and access to social support. Some of these factors increase the risk for SUDs, whereas other factors provide buffers against those risks. Nonetheless, specific combinations of factors can drive the emergence and continuation of problematic substance use and the progression to an SUD.

The Brain and Stages of Addiction –
A More Advanced Neurobiological Perspective

This section is largely supplemental. It discusses some newer and more detailed terminology and concepts underlying the neurobiology of addiction. At the heart of what has been presented thus far –

>> The nature of addiction is that, in vulnerable individuals, substance use disorders are developed through the interaction of the substances themselves with genetic, environmental, psychosocial, behavioral, and other factors, which causes long-lived alterations in the biochemical and functional properties of selected groups of neurons in the brain.

>> Addictive substances, when taken with adequate dose, frequency, and chronicity, appear to commandeer circuits intimately involved in the control of emotion and motivation, thus impairing the insight and voluntary control of the affected person. At the same time, the alterations produced by chronic substance use facilitate the formation of deeply ingrained emotional memories that influence drug craving and can lead to relapse.28
