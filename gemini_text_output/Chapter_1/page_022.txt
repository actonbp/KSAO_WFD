Landmark Legislation and Policies Facilitating a Recovery Orientation

The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 legislated that discrimination on the basis of disability, including mental disability, is not acceptable or legal (Senate (S.) Bill 933-101st Congress: The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 1989).

In the Olmstead Decision, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1999 that people with disabilities have a right to live in communities rather than institutions (Olmstead, 1999).

The 2006 Institute of Medicine report, Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions, endorsed recovery-based approaches including supporting patients' decision-making abilities and preferences (Institute of Medicine, 2006).

The 2007 State Medicaid Director Letter on Peer Delivered Services established guidance on how to bill for peer-operated services (Smith, 2007).

The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 legislated equal insurance benefits for mental health and substance use and medical/surgical services (H.R. Bill 1424-110th Congress: Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, 2007).

The Affordable Care Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-148 – 111th Congress: Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, 2010) proposed the expansion of health insurance coverage and mandated further parity of mental health and substance use services.

SAMHSA's 2011 Leading Change: A Plan for SAMHSA's Roles and Actions 2011–2014 which includes "Recovery Supports" as one of eight (8) agency initiatives and identifies the domains of "health, home, purpose, and community" as key for recovery (DHHS/SAMHSA, 2011).

The Stages of Change (SOC) Model
Substantial research in the behavioral health realm has focused on the determinants and mechanisms of change. By understanding better how people change, researchers and counselors have become better able to develop and apply interventions to facilitate changes in clients' substance use behaviors and recovery.

Many adults in the United States resolve an SUD without assistance. This is considered natural recovery. "Natural recovery" (sometimes called unassisted recovery) refers to achieving recovery from problematic substance use through self-management. Recovery from SUDs can happen with limited treatment or participation in mutual-aid support groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous. Behavior change is a process that occurs over time. Everyone must make decisions about important life changes, such as marriage or divorce or buying a house. Sometimes, individuals consult a counselor or other specialist to help with these ordinary decisions, but usually people decide on such changes without professional assistance.

Prochaska and DiClemente theorized that the change process is a journey through stages in which people typically think about behavior change, initiate behavior change, and maintain new behaviors. This model emerged from an examination of 18 psychological and behavioral theories about how change occurs. In this sense, the model is "transtheoretical." This model has come to be known as the TTM of the Stages of Change (SOC). TTM is not the only SOC model, but it is the most widely researched.

SOC is not a specific counseling method but a framework that can help counselors tailor specific counseling strategies to clients in different stages. Although results are mixed regarding its usefulness, in the past 30 years, TTM has demonstrated effectiveness in predicting positive SUD treatment outcomes and has shown value as an overarching theoretical framework for counseling.
