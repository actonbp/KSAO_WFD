CHAPTER 1: Scientific Perspectives on Substance Use Disorders and Recovery 13

their choices and actions - and, by focusing on proper clinical care, SUDs can be addressed with compassion, free from blame, negative attitudes, and harsh treatment or punishment. The moral model, however, has been largely criticized and replaced by more scientifically grounded models.

Research has revealed more exactly how substances work in the brain, and how SUDs can be successfully treated to help people stop and resume their productive lives.⁷ The initial decision to use substances is mostly voluntary; however, when the use progresses to more regular use, a person's ability to exert self-control can become seriously impaired. Today, the disease model of addiction is the prevailing theory - that addiction is an illness and comes about because of the impairment of healthy neurochemical or behavioral processes. Advances in neuroscience have helped us understand how substances affect the brain, leading to the recognition that addiction is a chronic brain disorder that can be treated.

Dr. Nora Volkow, NIDA Director, and colleagues state:
"Neuroscience research has revealed that addiction is a chronic, relapsing disease of the brain triggered by repeated exposure to drugs in those who are vulnerable because of genetics and developmental or adverse social exposures. As a result, the reward circuit's capacity to respond to reward and motivate actions that are not drug related is decreased, the sensitivity of the emotional circuits to stress is enhanced, and the capacity to self-regulate is impaired. The result is compulsive drug seeking and drug taking despite severe harms and an inability to control the strong urges to consume the drug, even when there is a strong desire to quit."⁸

Simply stated, the disease model emphasizes the brain areas and circuits that encode various functions such as reward and motivation. Brain imaging studies from individuals with a substance use disorder show physical changes in areas of the brain that are critical to judgment, decision making, learning and memory, and behavior control. The pattern of use of a substance is characterized by the loss of control on substance use-related behaviors, the pursuance of those behaviors even in the presence of negative consequences, and a strong motivated activity to continue using. The causation of these behaviors and motivations can be viewed from psychological to biological-molecular levels.⁹

The disease model has also been criticized. Opponents to this model often claim that the biological understanding removes personal responsibility and moral culpability for problematic use of substances, and that individuals will use their "disease" as a "crutch." Thus, they are neither responsible nor to blame as their condition is the result of a disease that has taken hold.¹⁰ Others oppose addiction being labeled as a disease; that it is an unnecessary and negative frame that distracts from the positive and hopeful messages that can accompany a full understanding of addiction as a biobehavioral disorder.¹¹

Blended model. There is an ongoing debate about whether substance use disorders should be viewed as a moral failing or as a disease. Some researchers suggest that neither perspective fully captures the complexity, and that a more nuanced and integrated understanding is needed. We see that scientific advances have contributed significantly to our understanding of the neurobiological pathways in the brain and their roles in substance reinforcement, dependence, conditioned responses, craving, and loss of behavioral control.

Yet, it is known that sustained recovery from substance use comes through the empowerment of an individual to be an "agent" in their own life (meaning the degree to which they are able to make decisions and carry out actions that they choose for themselves) and the restoration of their belief in their ability to affect change and progress. It is argued that individuals must want different goals and make different choices to overcome their SUD, thus the elements of choice and personal responsibility cannot be discounted.¹² Not all interventions that help persons with SUDs involve choice - many things will always lie outside of their control - but, choice and personal responsibility are nonetheless crucial elements in personal change, growth, and recovery.
