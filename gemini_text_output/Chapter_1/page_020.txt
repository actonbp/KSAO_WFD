**RECOVERY-RELATED VALUES AND PRINCIPLES**

There are several principles upon which the concept of recovery is based. SAMHSA, in collaboration with persons in recovery, has also created a set of guiding values and principles that have come to be commonly accepted as the standards for effective delivery of recovery-focused care.

SAMHSA has delineated four major dimensions that support a life in recovery:

*   **Health:** overcoming or managing one's disease(s) as well as living in a physically and emotionally healthy way
*   **Home:** a stable and safe place to live
*   **Purpose:** meaningful daily activities, such as a job, school, volunteerism, family caretaking, or creative endeavors, and the independence, income and resources to participate in society
*   **Community:** relationships and social networks that provide support, friendship, love, and hope

There are ten principles upon which the concept of recovery is based.

*   **Recovery emerges from hope:** The belief that recovery is real provides the essential and motivating message of a better futureâ€”that people can and do overcome the internal and external challenges, barriers, and obstacles that confront them. Hope is internalized and can be fostered by peers, families, providers, allies, and others. Hope is the catalyst of the recovery process.
*   **Recovery is person-centered:** Self-determination and self-direction are the foundations for recovery as individuals define their own life goals and design their unique path(s) towards those goals.
*   **Recovery occurs via many pathways:** Recovery is built on the multiple capacities, strengths, talents, coping abilities, resources, and inherent value of each individual. Recovery pathways are highly personalized. Recovery is non-linear, characterized by continual growth and improved functioning that may involve setbacks.
*   **Recovery is holistic:** Recovery encompasses an individual's whole life, including mind, body, spirit, and community. The array of services and supports available should be integrated and coordinated.
*   **Recovery is supported by peers and allies:** Mutual support and mutual aid groups play an invaluable role in recovery. Peers encourage and engage other peers and provide each other with a vital sense of belonging, supportive relationships, valued roles, and community. Professionals also play an important role in the recovery process by providing clinical treatment and other services that support individuals in their chosen recovery paths.
