the spinal cord, and nerves in the rest of the body (the peripheral nervous system). Others are involved with thinking, learning, emotions, and memory or communicate with muscles, stimulating them into action. The addiction cycle disrupts the normal functions of some of these neuronal networks.

ADDICTIVE SUBSTANCES AND THE BRAIN
Alcohol, drugs, and other substances interfere with the way neurons send, receive, and process signals via neurotransmitters. Some drugs, such as marijuana and heroin, can activate neurons because their chemical structure mimics that of a natural neurotransmitter in the body. This allows the drugs to attach onto and activate the neurons. Although these drugs mimic the brain's own chemicals, they don't activate neurons in the same way as a natural neurotransmitter, and they lead to abnormal messages being sent through the network.
Other drugs, such as amphetamine or cocaine, can cause the neurons to release abnormally large amounts of natural neurotransmitters or prevent the normal recycling of these brain chemicals by interfering with transporters. This too amplifies or disrupts the normal communication between neurons.

PRIMARY BRAIN REGIONS INVOLVED IN SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS
The brain has many interconnected regions that are responsible for specific functions, such as attention, self-regulation, perception, language, reward, emotion, and movement, along with many other functions. There are three regions in the brain that are the key components of networks that are intricately involved in the development and persistence of SUDs: the basal ganglia, the extended amygdala, and the prefrontal cortex.

>> The basal ganglia are a group of structures located deep within the brain that play a significant role in keeping body movements smooth and coordinated. They are also involved in learning routine behaviors and forming habits. Two sub-regions of the basal ganglia are particularly important in substance use disorders:
> The nucleus accumbens, which is involved in motivation and the experience of reward, and
> The dorsal striatum, which is involved in forming habits and other routine behaviors.
The basal ganglia form a key node of the brain's "reward circuit." Substances over-activate this circuit, producing the euphoria of the "high." But with repeated exposure, the circuit adapts to the presence of the substance, diminishing its sensitivity and making it hard to feel pleasure from anything besides the substance.

>> The extended amygdala and its sub-regions, located beneath the basal ganglia, regulate the brain's reactions to stressâ€”including behavioral responses like "fight or flight" and negative emotions like unease, anxiety, and irritability. This region also interacts with the hypothalamus, an area of the brain that controls activity of multiple hormone-producing glands, such as the pituitary gland at the base of the brain and the adrenal glands at the top of each kidney. These glands, in turn, control reactions to stress and regulate many other bodily processes.
The extended amygdala plays a role in the development of the stressful feelings that characterize withdrawal after the substance's high fades and thus motivates the person to seek the substance again. This circuit becomes increasingly sensitive with increased substance use. Over time, a person with substance use disorder uses the substance to get temporary relief from this discomfort rather than to get high.

>> The prefrontal cortex is located at the very front of the brain, over the eyes, and is responsible for complex cognitive processes described as "executive function." Executive function is the ability to organize thoughts and activities, prioritize tasks, manage time, make decisions, and regulate one's actions, emotions, and impulses. This is also the last part of the brain to mature, making teens most vulnerable. Shifting balance between this circuit and the circuits of the basal ganglia and extended amygdala makes a person with a substance use disorder seek the substance compulsively with reduced impulse control.
