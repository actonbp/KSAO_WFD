This process is heavily influenced by dopamine, which not only signals pleasure but also enhances the incentive salience of substance-related cues, making them more attention-grabbing and desirable. The release of dopamine (along with activation of brain opioid systems) can eventually trigger changes that strengthen substance-seeking and substance-taking habits as addiction progresses. Repeated activation of the basal ganglia's reward system increases the likelihood of repeated consumption and compelling the individual to seek it out and consume it again.

2. Negative Emotional States: This is the "withdrawal" phase. Negative emotional states, such as anxiety, depression, and irritability, are predominant during the withdrawal and negative effect stage. The absence of the substance leads to a decrease in dopamine levels, which is associated with the reward system's functioning. This reduction causes the brain's mood-regulating systems to become imbalanced, resulting in negative emotional states.

The negative feelings associated with the diminished activation in the reward systems—or a reward deficit—of the basal ganglia makes it difficult for people to experience the pleasures of everyday living. The increased activation of the brain's stress systems in the extended amygdala contributes to anxiety, irritability, and unease. These unpleasant feelings can drive the individual to use the substance again to alleviate the discomfort, perpetuating the cycle of addiction.

3. Executive Function: This is "the craving" stage. Executive function refers to a set of thought processes that include decision-making, impulse control, and planning. During the preoccupation and anticipation stage, these functions are compromised, making it difficult for the individual to resist cravings or think about the long-term consequences of substance use. The brain's prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for executive functions is often impaired in people with problematic substance use, leading to increased impulsivity and a strong focus on seeking immediate rewards. This impairment makes it challenging for individuals to resist the urge to return to substance use, thus fueling the addiction cycle.
