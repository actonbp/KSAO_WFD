COMMONLY USED SUBSTANCES

Drugs, including alcohol and other substances, are categorized into several types based on their effects and the way they are used. The following categories represent the drugs most often used problematically.

1. Opioids: These include prescription pain relievers (like oxycodone, hydrocodone, and morphine), as well as illegal drugs like heroin. Opioids are known for their pain-relieving properties and are highly addictive.

2. Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants: This category includes benzodiazepines (like Valium, Xanax, and Klonopin), which are prescribed for anxiety and sleep disorders, as well as barbiturates and sleep medications. They are used for their calming effects but can be addictive and dangerous, especially when combined with other substances like alcohol.

3. Stimulants: These include prescription drugs like amphetamines (Adderall, Ritalin) used to treat ADHD, as well as illegal substances like cocaine and methamphetamine. MDMA (Ecstasy) is both a stimulant and a hallucinogen. Stimulants are used for their energy-boosting and focus-enhancing effects but are highly addictive and can have dangerous cardiovascular consequences.

4. Cannabis: Marijuana and synthetic cannabinoids are used for their psychoactive effects. While marijuana is legal for medical or recreational use in many states, it can still be used to excess, leading to impaired cognitive functions and potential psychological dependence.

5. Hallucinogens: LSD, psilocybin mushrooms, and PCP are examples of hallucinogens. They are known for causing altered perceptions and sensory experiences but can lead to unpredictable and risky behavior.

6. Inhalants: Substances like solvents, aerosol sprays, gases, and nitrites are abused for their psychoactive effects. Inhalants are particularly dangerous due to their toxic nature and potential for immediate harm to the heart, brain, and lungs.

7. Dissociatives: This category includes drugs like PCP and ketamine, which cause a sense of detachment from reality.

8. Nicotine: Found in tobacco products, nicotine is highly addictive and harmful to health.

9. Alcohol: Though legal, alcohol is one of the most used substances due to its widespread availability and social acceptance. Chronic problem use can lead to addiction and serious health issues.
