CHAPTER 1: Scientific Perspectives on Substance Use Disorders and Recovery 29

» Recovery is supported through relationship and social networks: An important factor in the recovery process is the presence and involvement of people who believe in the person's ability to recover; who offer hope, support, and encouragement; and who also suggest strategies and resources for change. Family members, peers, providers, faith groups, community members, and other allies form vital support networks.

» Recovery is culturally-based and influenced: Culture and cultural background in all of its diverse representations - including values, traditions, and beliefs - are keys in determining a person's journey and unique pathway to recovery. Services should be culturally grounded, attuned, sensitive, congruent, and competent, as well as personalized to meet each individual's unique needs.

» Recovery is supported by addressing trauma: The experience of trauma (such as physical or sexual abuse, domestic violence, war, disaster, and others) is often a precursor to or associated with alcohol and drug use, mental health conditions, and related issues. Services and supports should be trauma-informed to foster safety (physical and emotional) and trust, as well as promote choice, empowerment, and collaboration.

» Recovery involves individual, family, and community strengths and responsibility: Individuals, families, and communities have strengths and resources that serve as a foundation for recovery. Individuals have a personal responsibility for their own self-care and journeys of recovery. Families and significant others have responsibilities to support their loved ones, especially for children and youth in recovery.

» Recovery is based on respect: Community, systems, and societal acceptance and appreciation for people affected by mental health and substance use disorders - including protecting their rights and eliminating discrimination - are crucial in achieving recovery. Self-acceptance, developing a positive and meaningful sense of identity, and regaining belief in oneself are particularly important.

Recovery-Oriented System of Care (ROSC)

A Recovery-Oriented System of Care (ROSC) focuses on the individual, emphasizing wellness and utilizing the strengths and resources of the person, their family, and community to enhance overall functioning. It's grounded in the key aspects and values of recovery, ensuring the care system is cohesive and comprehensive. Without such an integrated service network, individuals risk getting lost in a disjointed care system.42,43

In a ROSC, the priority is the individual's recovery and resilience, incorporating accessible, fair services, and fostering hope in the community for those receiving help. It acknowledges that recovery might have ups and downs but aims to provide the necessary tools, knowledge, and support for individuals to improve their health and wellness, lead a self-directed life, and achieve their potential. ROSC offers a range of personalized, people-focused, and strength-based services within a network defined by the individual. It covers the full spectrum of care from prevention and early intervention to resource distribution and community support, ensuring people get the right help at the right time. It facilitates smooth transitions within the behavioral health system, making sure individuals get the needed services at any entry point through referrals and connections.45 This recovery orientation is interwoven throughout this study guide with examples of how an SUD counselor can incorporate the ROSC attitudes and principles in their various job tasks.
