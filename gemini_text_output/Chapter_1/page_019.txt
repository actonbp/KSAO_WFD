RECOVERY PERSPECTIVES AND PRINCIPLES
Recovery from substance use-related problems involves a highly individualized journey toward wellness, satisfying relationships, engagement in community, and a sense of meaning and purpose. Despite setbacks that many face along the way, people can and do recover. This modern concept of recovery (which research and practice support) differs significantly from one that sees recovery only in terms of total abstinence and remission of symptoms. It also differs from the traditional approach to problematic substance use that emphasizes acute, episodic, clinician-driven, siloed treatments. A new recovery-oriented focus has given way to an approach that emphasizes longer term, person-driven, holistic, and integrated recovery-oriented care.

Historically, there have been many definitions of *recovery*. Most definitions found in the behavioral health literature involve components of acceptance of illness, having a sense of hope about the future, and finding a renewed sense of self.<sup>37</sup> Advocates and national leaders, including individuals in recovery, family members, representatives of mutual-help organizations, treatment providers, and government officials, comprised a "recovery movement" that accelerated in the early 2000's. They paved the way for the development of a set of recovery values and beliefs that could be embraced by all. In 2012, these groups and individuals collaborated with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) to create a modern definition of recovery for behavioral health conditions (substance use and mental health).

"Recovery is a process of change whereby individuals improve their health and wellness, to live a self-directed life, and strive to reach their full potential."<sup>38</sup>

This definition of recovery signals a dramatic shift in the expectation for positive outcomes for individuals who experience mental health and substance use conditions or the co-occurrence of the two. It acknowledges recovery as a complex and dynamic process.

Distinctions have been made within the definition of recovery to address the various aspect of:

>> clinical recovery (symptom remission or abstinence),
>> functional recovery (getting a job and coping with daily life demands),
>> personal recovery (improvements in wellbeing and life satisfaction, regaining a positive sense of identity) and,
>> social recovery (developing strong and supportive social networks).<sup>39</sup>

These yield a recovery process unique to each person. While recovery is often described as a "journey," this does not necessarily mean that it has an endpoint. Some people view recovery in terms of abstinence and remission of symptoms, whereas others may focus on controlling or reducing use. Some people may pursue multiple approaches to recovery at the same time or for overlapping periods; some may try different approaches in turn; and others may find a single approach that works for them and stick with it. Regardless, a person's recovery is built on their strengths, abilities, resources, and values, addressing the whole person and their community.
