FACTORS AFFECTING INDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY AND VULNERABILITY

The development of an SUD involves complex interactions between the drug's effects, personal factors like genetics and health, social relationships, and cultural influences such as attitudes towards alcohol and other drugs, and their availability. Examining issues like adverse social conditions, childhood experiences, and genetic differences is crucial to understanding why some people develop SUDs and others don’t.13

As with any other disease, vulnerability to developing an SUD differs from person to person. In general, the more risk factors an individual has, the greater the chance that substances will lead to an SUD. Risk factors can be impacted by protective factors which are characteristics associated with a lower likelihood of negative outcomes and can help to reduce a risk factor’s impact. For example, negative life events (risk factors) are associated with substance use as well as anxiety, depression, and other behavioral health issues. Prevention efforts targeting a set of risk or protective factors have the potential to produce positive effects.

Genetic Factors. SUDs are heritable and influenced by complex interactions among multiple genes and environmental factors. Genetic studies have begun to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying SUDs and related traits, including other psychiatric conditions with which SUDs frequently co-occur. Scientists estimate that genes account for between 40 and 60 percent of a person’s risk of developing an SUD.14

Gender. Gender significantly impacts the risk of developing an SUD. Both men and women show differences in their vulnerabilities to various substances and activities, including drugs, sex, food, gambling, internet use, and physical exercise.15 Hormonal differences, particularly the influence of sex hormones, play a significant role in compulsive behaviors. In addition, the responsiveness to stress and other socio-cultural factors contribute to sex- and gender-based differences in the development of an SUD. Women experience some issues to a greater degree than men which add to their vulnerability, such as intimate partner influences and/or violence, mental health conditions, and higher susceptibility to the addictive properties of substances, craving, and relapse.16

Home and Family. The influence of the home environment is usually most important in childhood. Exposure to childhood adversity, including family dysfunction, domestic violence, parental substance use, and mental health conditions, significantly increases the risk for SUDs.17 Early sexual assaultive trauma, especially before age 10, alters neurophysiological functioning in adolescents and young adults which influences the risk of SUDs and conditions characterized by negative emotion such as depression, anxiety, and phobias.18

Peer and School. Friends and acquaintances have the greatest influence during adolescence. Substance-using peers can sway even those without risk factors to try alcohol, drugs, or other substances (such as inhalants) for the first time. Academic failure or poor social skills can put a child further at risk for problematic use.19

Method of Administration. Smoking a substance or injecting it into a vein increases its addictive potential. Each substance and method of administration carries its own set of risks and potential for progression to an SUD. The speed of onset, meaning the faster the substance reaches the brain, the more intense the high and the greater the addictive potential. Intravenous injection delivers the substance directly into the bloodstream, providing an almost immediate effect. Inhalation, as in smoking, also leads to rapid absorption through the lungs. These methods can increase the risk of developing an SUD compared to slower routes like oral ingestion. The intensity of the effect can produce a “rush” which can be more reinforcing.

Early Use. Although problematic substance use at any age can lead to an SUD, research shows that the earlier a person begins to use alcohol, drugs, or other substances, the more likely they are to progress to more serious use. Young people’s brains are growing and developing until they are their mid-20’s. Early substance use interferes with ongoing neurodevelopment to trigger neurobiological changes that further augment SUD risk. In addition, risk-taking and subsequent drug experimentation during adolescence increases the likelihood of developing an SUD.20

Survivors of Trauma and Violence: Research has shown that traumatic experiences are associated with both behavioral health and chronic physical health conditions, especially when those traumatic events occur during childhood. Substance use, mental health conditions, and other risky behaviors are linked with traumatic experiences.21 For example,
