CHAPTER 1: Scientific Perspectives on Substance Use Disorders and Recovery

Lastly, we chose to use the term **client** in this publication to represent people accessing and using substance use related services. There has been recent opposition to the use of "client," as well as the term "patient," as opponents believe it is disempowering and suggests an unequal healthcare relationship. Other terms, such as "person served," "consumer," or "service user," have been suggested as replacements. It is widespread practice, however, for therapists and counselors in non-medical, behavioral health settings to use "client," while practitioners in other healthcare settings generally use the term "patients." A search of current practice publications related to treating substance use disorders shows the use of "client" in current publications from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA.) Given the familiarity with the term, current usage, and ease of writing, the term "client" was selected for this publication with the full intent that this term represents today's person-centered healthcare practices.

Overall, the commitment of this study guide is to use language that is respectful, non-stigmatizing, and aligns with current professional understanding.
