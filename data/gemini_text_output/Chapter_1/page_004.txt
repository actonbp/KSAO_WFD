**CURRENT SCIENTIFIC PERSPECTIVES ON ADDICTION**

Scientific breakthroughs have revolutionized the understanding of substance use disorders. For example, severe substance use disorders, were once viewed as a moral failing or character flaw but are now understood to be chronic illnesses characterized by clinically significant impairments in health, social function, and voluntary control over substance use. Although the mechanisms may be different, SUDs have many features in common with disorders such as diabetes, asthma, and hypertension. All of these disorders are chronic, subject to relapse, and influenced by genetic, developmental, behavioral, social, and environmental factors.

The National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) defines addiction as:³
> “*Addiction is a chronic, relapsing disorder characterized by compulsive drug seeking and use despite adverse consequences. It is considered as a brain disorder because it involves functional changes to brain circuits involved in reward, stress, and self-control. Those changes may last a long time after a person has stopped taking drugs.*”

The American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) updated their definition of addiction in 2019 to reflect a modern understanding and acceptance of addiction as a chronic brain disease, the possibility of remission and recovery, and the roles of prevention and harm reduction in the spectrum of addiction and recovery.⁴
> “*Addiction is a treatable, chronic medical disease involving complex interactions among brain circuits, genetics, the environment, and an individual’s life experiences. People with addiction use substances or engage in behaviors that become compulsive and often continue despite harmful consequences. Prevention efforts and treatment approaches for addiction are generally as successful as those for other chronic diseases.*”

Repeated substance use can lead to brain changes that challenge a person’s self-control and interfere with their ability to resist intense urges to take the substance. These brain changes can be persistent, which is why an SUD is considered a “relapsing” disease. People in recovery from an SUD are at increased risk for returning to substance use even after years of not taking the substance. Brain imaging studies of people with an SUD show physical changes in areas of the brain that are critical to judgment, decision-making, learning and memory, and behavior control.

All addictive substances have powerful effects on the brain. These effects account for the euphoric or intensely pleasurable feelings that people experience during their initial use of alcohol, drugs or other substances, and these feelings motivate people to use those substances repeatedly, despite the risks for significant harms.

**Theories of Causation and Factors that Influence Addiction**

There are many theories about the causes of substance use disorders. Biology, psychology, and social and cultural elements all interplay in complex ways that result in SUDs. Varying theories weigh the elements differently. Together they reflect the fact that there is no one path to an SUD, and no one factor that determines an inevitable outcome. Two general and identifiable sets of views about the causation of addiction have persisted in the public domain: biological/disease views and moral views.

**The moral model** views addiction as a result of personal weakness, initiated for self-gratification and continued because of an unwillingness or lack of sufficient willpower to stop.⁵ In this model, problematic behaviors are seen not as symptoms of a disease or disorder, but rather as the result of bad choices driven by poor character or ethical weakness. This perspective often leads to stigmatization and blame placed on the individual rather than considering biological, psychological, or socio-environmental factors that might contribute to the substance use. Proponents of the moral model believe that people with SUDs can and should be held to moral responsibility for
