CHAPTER 3:
CO-OCCURRING CONDITIONS AND
SPECIAL POPULATIONS86 IC&RC Alcohol and Drug Counselor (ADC) Certification Examination Study Guide

**INTRODUCTION**

Substance use disorders (SUDs) and mental health disorders (MHDs) frequently coexist and are generally known as co-occurring disorders (CODs). They also intertwine with physical illnesses, creating a complex interplay that significantly worsens health outcomes and amplifies the severity and intricacies of each condition. This interconnectedness can lead to a vicious cycle where each disorder worsens the others, complicating diagnosis, treatment, and recovery. This chapter emphasizes the importance of recognizing and addressing this triad for healthcare providers, including SUD counselors, to develop comprehensive, integrated treatment plans and service arrays that enhance overall health and quality of life for affected individuals.

Additionally, the chapter examines the specific obstacles faced by special population groups in accessing and receiving adequate substance use and mental health services. These groups often encounter heightened barriers due to social, economic, and cultural factors. Understanding the characteristics and special considerations for each special population is essential for counselors and healthcare providers. Tailoring services to meet the unique needs of these populations ensures that care is both accessible and effective, and equitable.

**CO-OCCURRING SUBSTANCE USE AND MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS**

The intersection of SUDs and MHDs presents a complex challenge in both diagnosis and treatment. Commonly referred to as **co-occurring disorders** (CODs) or “dual diagnosis,” this term means the simultaneous presence of at least one SUD and one MHD. It is important to note that some clients’ substance use behaviors may not fully meet the strict diagnostic criteria for co-occurring SUDs and vice versa for mental health symptoms and MHDs. For example, an individual may be at the stage of problematic substance use, but not fully at a diagnosable SUD; however, many of the relevant principles that apply to the treatment of CODs will also apply to these individuals. Careful assessment and treatment planning to take each disorder into account will still be important.

SUDs and MHDs have historically been viewed through separate lenses. The interdependence between them is now widely recognized. The 2022 *National Survey on Drug Use and Health* suggests that mental illness (and serious mental illness (SMI) in particular) commonly co-occurs with problematic substance use in the general adult population, and many individuals with CODs go untreated. This survey, based on a sample of 71,369 U.S. civilians ages 12 or older in noninstitutionalized settings offers revealing insights.¹

» Nearly half of young adults aged 18 to 25 (48.8% or 17.0 million people) had either any mental illness (AMI) or any SUD in the past year. This percentage was higher than corresponding percentages among adults aged 26 to 49 (40.6% or 41.7 million people) or adults aged 50 or older (21.5% or 25.6 million people). .²

» The percentage of adults aged 18 or older who had both SMI and an SUD in the past year was highest among young adults aged 18 to 25 (6.0% or 2.1 million people). The percentage of adults aged 26 to 49 with both SMI and an SUD (3.7% or 3.8 million people) also was higher than the percentage among adults aged 50 or older (1.3% or 1.5 million people).

» The percentage of adults aged 18 or older who had either an SUD or AMI in the past year was higher among Multiracial adults (46.4%) than among White (34.0%), Hispanic (31.7%), Black (31.3%), Asian adults (22.5%) or American Indian or Alaska Native adults (35.9%).

» Two (2) in five (5) adults aged 18 or older (40.9%) with co-occurring MHD/SUD in the past year did not receive treatment for either condition. An estimated 37.9% of adults aged 18 or older with co-occurring AMI and an SUD in the past year received only mental health treatment, 4.2% received only substance use treatment, and 17.0% received both types of treatment.

» Three (3) in ten (10) adolescents aged 12 to 17 (28.4%) with a co-occurring major depressive disorder and an SUD in the past year did not receive treatment for either condition. An estimated 49.3% of adolescents aged 12 to 17 with these co-occurring conditions in the past year received only mental health treatment, 1.5% received only substance use treatment, and 20.8% received both substance use treatment and mental health treatment.[Layout: Single column of text with a header across the top.

The Bidirectional Nature of Co-Occurring Disorders²

Counselors working with clients who have CODs often want to know which disorder developed first. The answer is not always clear because the temporal nature of CODs can be inconsistent and nuanced. In some cases, a MHD may obviously have led to the development of an SUD. An example would be someone with a long-standing major depressive disorder who starts using alcohol excessively to cope and develops alcohol use disorder. In other instances, substance use clearly precipitated the MHD—such as when someone develops a cocaine-induced psychotic disorder. In many cases, it will be uncertain which disorder occurred first. For some clients, there may be a third condition that is influencing both or either of the two comorbid disorders (e.g., HIV, chronic pain). Environmental factors, like homelessness or extreme stress, can also affect one or both disorders. Thus, even when it is clear which disorder developed first, the causal relationship may be unknown.

Though people might have both an SUD and a MHD, that does not mean that one caused the other. Research suggests three possibilities that could explain why SUDs and other MHDs may occur together:³

» Common risk factors can contribute to both SUDs and MHDs. Both can run in families, meaning certain genes may be a risk factor. Environmental factors, such as stress or trauma, can cause genetic changes that are passed down through generations and may contribute to the development of a MHD or SUD.

» MHDs can contribute to substance use and SUDs. Studies found that people with a MHD, such as anxiety, depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), may use drugs or alcohol to help alleviate symptoms. However, although some drugs may temporarily help with some symptoms of MHDs, they may make the symptoms worse over time. Additionally, brain changes in people with MHDs may enhance the rewarding effects of substances, making it more likely they will continue to use the substance.

» Substance use and SUDs can contribute to the development of MHDs. Substance use may trigger changes in brain structure and function that make a person more likely to develop a MHD.

Regardless of the causal relationship between a client’s SUD and MHD, the two are likely to affect, and possibly worsen, one another. This means that both need to be treated with equal seriousness. CODs are not necessarily equal in severity. Often, one disorder is more severe, distressing, or impairing than the other. Recognizing this is important for treatment planning and requires a person-centered rather than cookie-cutter approach to determining diagnosis, comorbidities, functioning, treatment and referral needs, and stage of change.

The notion that SUDs are caused, in whole or in part, by one’s attempts to “self-medicate” symptoms with alcohol or illicit drugs has been a source of debate. SAMHSA cautions that the term “self-medication” should not be used, as it equates drugs that are misused (which usually worsen health) with true medications (which are designed to improve health). Although some people with MHDs may use substances problematically to alleviate their symptoms or otherwise cope, this is not always the case. Counselors should not assume self-medication is the causal link between a client’s MHD and SUD.

Mental Health Disorders

Identifying and diagnosing co-occurring SUDs and MHDs is a complex but essential task for effective treatment. Screening and assessing these disorders accurately require understanding their intertwined symptoms and choosing treatments that address all aspects of a client’s needs. Often, people with these co-occurring disorders either receive treatment for just one issue or none, making a comprehensive approach critical. See Chapter 4 for complete information on effective screening and assessment practices and instruments.

Diagnosing CODs is challenging because symptoms of substance use and mental health issues can overlap and influence each other. For instance, using substances like alcohol and stimulants might cause symptoms similar to MHDs such as anxiety, depression, or psychosis. This makes it hard to tell if the symptoms are due to substance use or an underlying MHD. A detailed assessment and sometimes a period without substance use are necessary to identify the true source of the symptoms.⁵[Image: A black and white photograph shows a distressed young man sitting down, holding his head with one hand. Three other people are around him, offering comfort. A young woman on the left, wearing a striped shirt, looks at him with concern. Another person, possibly a woman with dark hair, stands behind him with a hand on his shoulder. A third young woman on the right, with long dark hair, is also looking at him with concern, holding a mug.]

CHAPTER 3: Co-Occurring Conditions and Special Populations 89

Entry level SUD counselors generally do not diagnose MHDs but may be asked to give a “diagnostic impression.” **A diagnostic impression** refers to an initial determination made by a behavioral health professional regarding what mental health issues or disorders may be present based on observed symptoms and preliminary assessments. It’s a tentative hypothesis about a client’s condition that is used to guide further evaluation and treatment planning. This impression may later be confirmed or revised after more comprehensive testing and analysis. When providing a diagnostic impression, counselors who are not authorized to provide a full diagnosis need to clearly communicate the preliminary nature of their observations. They should emphasize that a definitive diagnosis must be made by a qualified professional.

It is important, however, that all SUD treatment counselors have familiarity with MHD terminology and criteria, as well as to be an active member of the treatment team in providing opinions on how to proceed with clients who demonstrate symptoms of these disorders. The American Psychiatric Association (APA) is recognized as the organization that establishes criteria for diagnosing MHDs, including SUDs.⁶ The major categories include:

1. Mood Disorders (Major Depressive Disorder, Bipolar Disorder, Dysthymia)
2. Anxiety Disorders (Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder)
3. Personality Disorders (Borderline Personality Disorder, Narcissistic Personality Disorder, Antisocial Personality Disorder)
4. Psychotic Disorders (Schizophrenia, Schizoaffective Disorder)
5. Eating Disorders (Anorexia Nervosa, Bulimia Nervosa, Binge Eating Disorder)
6. Trauma-related Disorders (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Acute Stress Disorder, Adjustment Disorders)[Layout: Single column with a header. An image is placed on the right side of the page, next to the main text body.]

7. Substance Use and Addictive Disorders (Alcohol Use Disorder, Opioid Use Disorder, Cannabis Use Disorder, Hallucinogen Use Disorder, Inhalant Use Disorder, Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Use Disorder, Stimulant Use Disorder, Tobacco Use Disorder, Other (or Unknown) Substance Use Disorder; Gambling Disorder)

8. Neurodevelopmental Disorders (Autism Spectrum Disorder, Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Learning Disorders)

At the bottom, the logo "SAMHSA" is visible with "Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration" underneath it.]

The MHDs most likely to co-occur with SUDs include depressive disorders, bipolar I disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), personality disorders (PDs), anxiety disorders, schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, ADHD, and eating disorders.⁷

**Appendix C. Mental Health Disorders** in this study guide contains comprehensive summaries of the various disorders and the medications used to treat them. For more detailed information on specific disorders, diagnostic criteria, and recommended treatments, please access SAMHSA TIP 42: *Substance Use Disorder Treatment for People with Co-Occurring Disorders*.⁸

**Treatment Approaches⁹**

An individual with CODs may participate in recurrent episodes of treatment involving acute stabilization (e.g., crisis intervention, detoxification, psychiatric hospitalization) and specific ongoing treatment (e.g., supported housing, outpatient treatment, or residential treatment). Counselors need to understand that clients may engage in a series of treatment episodes, as many individuals with CODs progress gradually through repeated involvement in treatment.

Providers generally treat CODs in one of three ways:

» **Sequential/serial treatment.** First, the client is offered treatment for either the SUD or the MHD. After successfully completing treatment for one disorder, they are offered treatment for the other.

» **Simultaneous/parallel treatment.** The client receives treatment for both the SUD and the MHD at the same time, but the treatment is offered by different services, primarily in isolation from each other.

» **Integrated service.** The client benefits from the coordinated use of a single treatment plan that focuses on the two conditions simultaneously and uses multiple treatments, such as the combination of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy.

One of the downsides of sequential treatment is that it delays treatment, decreases motivation, and leads to a poorer outcome. The simultaneous treatment model is often fraught with difficulties in communication and cooperation between services, particularly on matters relating to privacy and confidentiality, in addition to confusion that may arise from different treatment philosophies. The integrated model is currently regarded as the “gold standard.”¹⁰

Treatment that addresses both disorders concurrently with the same provider or treatment team is called **integrated treatment.** This is the preferred method because it addresses all diagnoses and symptoms within one service system/agency/program and through a single team of providers working closely together. Integrated treatments for people with CODs have demonstrated superiority to nonintegrated approaches and help improve substance use, MHD symptoms, treatment retention, cost effectiveness, and client satisfaction.¹¹[Layout: The page has a header area with the chapter title on the left ("CHAPTER 3: Co-Occurring Conditions and Special Populations") and the page number on the right ("91"). Below this, the main content is in a column on the left, and a sidebar is on the right.]

CHAPTER 3: Co-Occurring Conditions and Special Populations
91

Integrated interventions are combined in a single session/interaction or
in a series of interactions/multiple sessions. Integrated interventions can
include a wide range of techniques. Some examples include:
    »   Integrated screening and assessment processes.
    »   Dual recovery mutual-support group meetings.
    »   Dual recovery therapeutic groups.
    »   Motivational enhancement interventions (individual or group) that
        address both MHDs and SUDs.
    »   Group interventions for people with the triple diagnosis of mental
        MHD, SUD, and another problem, such as a chronic medical
        condition (e.g., HIV), trauma, homelessness, or criminality.
    »   Combined psychopharmacological interventions, in which a person
        receives medication designed to reduce cravings for substances as
        well as medication for a MHD.

Integrated interventions for people with CODs can be implemented within
a single program or across multiple settings. These disorders vary widely
in severity and impact, requiring different levels of care ranging from
intensive inpatient services to occasional outpatient treatments. Not
everyone will need the same services or move through treatment in a
straightforward path. Clients may move between more and less intensive
care depending on their symptoms, capabilities, stability, and readiness
for change. For counselors specializing in SUDs, it’s crucial to work as part
of or in close collaboration with integrated treatment teams. These teams
often include various specialists like psychiatrists, psychologists, and
social workers who work together to create comprehensive, individualized
treatment plans.

**EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENTS**

Treating CODs presents unique challenges, as clients can have lower rates
of retention in services, more frequent recurrence of symptoms, and more
complex clinical management. SUD counselors need to be prepared for a
potentially prolonged treatment process and should be adept at managing
these challenges through continuous monitoring and adjustment of
treatment plans. The use of evidence-based treatment practices that have
shown efficacy in treating CODs can help facilitate the treatment process.

Here are several that have high levels of effectiveness for people with
CODs. These are reviewed in detail in Chapter 6. Evidence-based Practices.
    »   **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** CBT is effective in treating a range of MHDs and SUDs by helping
        clients understand the relationship between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors and by developing coping
        strategies to manage triggers and cravings.
    »   **Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT):** Originally developed for borderline personality disorder, DBT
        has been adapted for substance use treatment. It helps clients develop skills in mindfulness, distress
        tolerance, emotion regulation, and interpersonal effectiveness.
    »   **Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT):** MAT can be used to manage withdrawal symptoms, reduce
        cravings, and treat underlying MHDs. Medications like methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone for
        opioid use disorders, along with antidepressants or mood stabilizers, are commonly used.
    »   **Motivational Interviewing (MI):** This technique enhances a client’s motivation to change by resolving
        ambivalence, an essential component in treating clients with CODs who may have conflicting feelings
        about substance use and recovery.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**

Co-occurring disorders are
complex. They present significant
challenges for people living with
these disorders as well as for
the counselors, administrators,
supervisors, and programs who
treat them. To help address the
full range of symptoms that clients
experience and optimize outcomes,
service providers must understand
the components high-quality
care for CODs and use treatment
frameworks, philosophies, and
approaches empirically shown to net
the best outcomes.

One evidence-based practice used extensively is **Assertive Community Treatment (ACT)**. ACT was originally developed as a comprehensive approach to providing mental health services to individuals with severe and persistent MHDs.¹² The program model is designed to deliver intensive, personalized, and integrated services to clients in their natural environments, such as their homes or communities, rather than in traditional institutional settings. This includes assertive engagement with active outreach. ACT teams typically consist of a multidisciplinary group of professionals, including psychiatrists, nurses, social workers, counselors, and case managers, who work collaboratively to provide holistic care and support. ACT has evolved and been modified to address the needs of individuals with both MHDs and SUDs.¹³ It has the following features:

» **24/7 Availability:** ACT teams are available around the clock to provide crisis intervention and support, aiming to prevent hospitalizations and promote stability.
» **Personalized Care Plans:** Each client receives an individualized care plan that addresses their unique needs, goals, and preferences, with a focus on recovery and improving quality of life.
» **Integrated Treatment:** ACT emphasizes the integration of mental health services with other supports such as housing assistance, vocational training, SUD treatment, and peer support.
» **Practical Assistance in Life Management:** This feature incorporates case management activities that facilitate linkages with support services in the community. The role of a counselor in the ACT approach includes standard counseling, but in many instances substantial time also is spent on life management and behavioral management matters.

**MEDICATION FOR MHDs**¹⁴

MHDs are diseases of the brain or central nervous system. They affect a person's thinking, emotions, and mood. Medications play a key role in treating these disorders and are commonly used alongside other treatments such as counseling and brain stimulation therapies. Finding the right medication often involves trials to identify one that works effectively with minimal side effects.

Medications might be known by the disorders they most commonly treat but can be used for other disorders. For instance, a drug known as an “antidepressant” might also be useful for anxiety or eating disorders. Similarly, antipsychotics, while primarily linked to schizophrenia, are also used for bipolar disorder and severe depression. Given that medications can serve multiple purposes, it is essential to clarify for which condition a medication is prescribed.

The medication regimen may vary throughout the course of treatment, influenced by symptom severity, the client's age, and the effectiveness of initial treatments. Over time, a medication might become less effective, necessitating changes to the regimen or the addition of new drugs. Treatment approaches can also include periods without medication. For children and adolescents, it is crucial to carefully choose and monitor medications, as their reactions and side effects can differ from adults'. Certain medications, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), carry FDA warnings about potential risks, including an increased likelihood of suicidal thoughts in younger individuals. In some cases, medications approved for adults are prescribed off-label to treat symptoms in children, requiring vigilant monitoring.

A comprehensive care team is essential for managing MHD medication, including primary care providers, psychiatrists, and behavioral health professionals such as psychologists, social workers, or counselors. This team coordinates to monitor the effects and adjust treatments as needed, ensuring that medications are managed safely and effectively. An SUD counselor can play an important role in helping a client manage medications for a MHD in several ways.
» **Education:** The counselor can educate the client about the purpose, benefits, and potential side effects of their medications. This knowledge helps the client make informed decisions about their treatment plan.\
» **Medication Adherence and Monitoring:** The counselor can provide strategies to help the client remember to take their medications regularly and may monitor medication adherence and progress. This can involve regular check-ins, asking about any side effects or changes in symptoms, and assessing whether the medication is effectively managing the MHD.CHAPTER 3: Co-Occurring Conditions and Special Populations 93

» **Collaboration:** The counselor can collaborate and communicate with psychiatrists, primary care physicians or other healthcare professionals to ensure coordinated care and to address any concerns or adjustments needed regarding the medication regimen.
» **Addressing Barriers:** Sometimes, clients may face barriers to medication adherence, such as cost issues, stigma, or misconceptions about medications. The counselor can work with the client to address these barriers and find solutions.
» **Support and Counseling:** Emotional support and counseling can be offered by the counselor to help the client cope with any challenges related to their MHD and medication management, provide motivation, and assist in developing coping strategies.

Understanding medication side effects is important for client safety. This knowledge allows counselors to track how clients react to medications and quickly report any negative effects. Proactively addressing side effects helps counselors ease client concerns and collaborate with healthcare providers to adjust medications if needed. For instance, some antidepressants and antipsychotics can cause weight gain, which might worry clients with weight issues or body image concerns. Additionally, treatments for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder can lead to serious side effects such as metabolic changes, movement disorders (such as tardive dyskinesia), and heart issues.

**Issues Regarding Access to Treatment for People with CODs¹⁵**

Individuals with CODs disorders face numerous barriers that hinder their access to and retention in treatment. These obstacles span personal, cultural, societal, and systemic realms, each contributing to the underutilization of available treatment options and poor health outcomes.

1.  **Stigma and Societal Perception:** Stigma remains a formidable barrier, deeply rooted in societal perceptions that often label those with MHDs and SUDs as morally flawed or weak. This stigma extends from the general community into the workplace, deterring individuals from seeking treatment due to fear of discrimination and job loss. The stigma associated with these conditions can lead to decreased self-esteem, increased isolation, and reluctance to access treatment services due to fear of judgment.¹⁶

2.  **Cultural Barriers:** Cultural factors also play a critical role, particularly for ethnic minorities and immigrant populations who may face language barriers, lack of culturally competent care, and different cultural perceptions of mental health and problematic substance use. For instance, in some cultures, mental health issues are highly stigmatized, and admitting to such problems might be seen as bringing shame to the family.

3.  **Financial Constraints and Healthcare Access:** Economic barriers include the high cost of treatment, insufficient or lack of health insurance coverage or publicly funded programs. These economic factors are compounded in regions with limited healthcare infrastructure or in rural areas where health services are scarce.

4.  **Systemic and Structural Issues:** Systemic barriers include fragmented healthcare systems where mental health and substance use treatment services are not well integrated. This lack of integration can result in inconsistent treatment approaches, conflicting advice, and a complex navigation process for clients. Additionally, there might be a shortage of qualified professionals trained to deal with the complexities of CODs.

5.  **Population Specific Barriers:** Clients within special population groups (women, adolescents, justice-involved, veterans, etc.) with SUDs and MHDs may have specific barriers for accessing treatment and special treatment needs that do best with counseling approaches tailored to their diagnosis and levels of functioning. Many of these populations are reviewed at the latter part of this chapter.

CHAPTER 3: Co-Occurring Conditions and Special Populations 95

CIVIL COMMITMENT

Many people with CODs arrive in the treatment system through civil commitment procedures which are most often involuntary. Civil commitment refers to legal processes by which people other than the person with a MHD and/or a SUD can initiate treatment. This involves initiation of civil commitment proceedings and court-ordered treatment, including inpatient or assisted outpatient treatment (AOT). This process is typically initiated when an individual poses a significant risk to themselves or others due to their mental health and substance-related behaviors.

The specifics of the process can vary widely by jurisdiction but generally involve the following steps:

1.  **Petition**: A family member, mental health professional, or law enforcement officer files a petition stating that the individual requires involuntary treatment due to their inability to make decisions regarding their care.
2.  **Examination**: The individual is evaluated by one or more licensed mental health professionals who assess the severity of the mental health and substance use issues and the person’s capacity to consent to treatment.
3.  **Hearing**: A legal hearing is conducted where evidence [Unclear small superscript-like mark above the first 'e' in "evidence", possibly "is" or an artifact.] is presented by both the petitioner and the individual. The court considers evidence related to the person’s behavior, psychiatric history, and the risk they pose to themselves or others.
4.  **Judgment**: The judge decides whether involuntary treatment is necessary. If commitment is ordered, the individual may be placed in a treatment facility that can address both mental health and substance use needs.
5.  **Review**: The commitment is subject to periodic review and continued treatment is contingent on ongoing assessments that determine the need for further intervention under the law.

Rates of civil commitment among individuals with CODs tend to be higher than for those with a single type of disorder. This is largely because the combination of MHDs and SUDs can more severely impair judgment, increase the risk of harm to oneself or others, and diminish the capacity to seek or comply with treatment voluntarily. Studies suggest that individuals with CODs are more frequently encountered in emergency settings, where involuntary commitments often originate due to acute crises.17 Many states that had not previously enacted civil commitment laws for SUDs are turning to this type of law as a potential solution to address the recent rising rates of overdose deaths.

All states in the U.S. have civil commitment laws for mental health crisis situations. These laws govern the detainment and treatment of individuals who pose risks to themselves or others due to their MHDs. Currently, 35 states and the District of Columbia have also enacted civil commitment laws for SUDs. The statutes governing such care vary widely between jurisdictions, although many include similar criteria. Such criteria include:

[Text box on the right side of the page]
In 2019, the U.S. Conference of Chief Justices and Conference of State Court Administrators¹⁹ established the National Judicial Task Force to Examine State Courts’ Response to Mental Illness. As part of its overall efforts, a Model Legal Processes Workgroup was convened to develop model statutory language for court-ordered mental health treatment, emergency psychiatric intervention, medication over objection, and criminal matters involving persons with MHDs.

Their three-year undertaking produced a set of recommendations for legislative language that recognizes modern brain and behavioral research, while still being mindful of an individual’s rights to due process. The Workgroup issued its final report and recommendations in August 2022, which were then endorsed by the National Judicial Task Force in October 2022.96 IC&RC Alcohol and Drug Counselor (ADC) Certification Examination Study Guide

1. dangerousness to oneself or others
2. grave disability
3. lack of decision-making capacity (incapacitation)
4. inability to manage personal affairs and take care of basic needs
5. loss of control/substance use disorder.**18**

The involuntary aspect of civil commitment presents tension between an individual’s liberty interests and the
state’s interests in protecting citizens from danger. Those who support involuntary commitment for people with
SUDs/MHDs contend that allowing loved ones, healthcare providers, law enforcement, and others to quickly
secure court orders to confine the person as a last resort is a humane way to potentially save the life of someone
who is experiencing a crisis. Supporters also contend that states have a moral obligation to help those with an
SUD/MHD who cannot help themselves.

For involuntary commitment to work, effective treatment must be readily available while confined, as well as
upon the person’s release. While research indicates that involuntary treatment may be as effective as voluntary
treatment, many who oppose involuntary commitment do so because they believe that the loss of someone’s civil
liberties due to an SUD/MHD outweighs any therapeutic value from such commitment.**20** Additional concerns
surround the variability of civil commitment statutes and their implementation nationwide, and the fact that
outcome data are limited and often not generalizable.**21**

CHAPTER 3: Co-Occurring Conditions and Special Populations 97

**PHYSICAL HEALTH**

The majority of the U.S. healthcare resources are used by a small population characterized as high-risk, high-need persons with complex care needs (e.g., adults with multiple chronic conditions). SUDs and MHDs are drivers of poor health and additional healthcare costs.²² People experiencing an SUD and/or a MHD and chronic disease may have difficulty accessing or remaining in care, which can result in additional medical complications.²³ Chronic conditions, including diabetes, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, HIV, and hepatitis C, may require ongoing medical care and, in some cases, medication and medication management.

The comorbidity among SUDs, MHDs, and chronic disease represents triple jeopardy in terms of disease burden to affected individuals. Chronic problematic substance use and/or SUD alone can affect a wide range of organs and systems in the body, which may lead to multiple medical problems and an increased risk for contracting infectious diseases.²⁴ Individuals with either SUD or multiple chronic conditions have been found to be “super-utilizers” of hospital care (e.g., more readmissions, longer stays, higher costs).²⁵ In addition, the presence of SUDs or MHDs may interfere with an individual’s self-care behaviors, affect adherence to treatment regimen, or worsen existing medical diseases, leading to increased disease complications, healthcare resource utilization (e.g., hospitalization), or death.²⁶

Several large population studies that looked at the relationship between SUDs, MHDs, and diseases had consistent findings.²⁷, ²⁸, ²⁹ Although there is some variation, the studies primarily addressed multiple chronic diseases (arthritis, any chronic pain, heart disease, stroke, hypertension, diabetes, asthma, chronic lung disease, peptic ulcer, and cancer) across any mood disorder, anxiety disorder, impulse control disorder, and SUD. Here are some of the findings:
* An SUD or MHD usually preceded the onset of physical diseases.
* Those with SUDs and/or MHDs were diagnosed with a greater number of different physical diseases over time, and the onset of the disease(s) was much sooner than people witout SUD/MHD.
* In analyzing a matrix of possible associations between 16 SUDs/MHDs and subsequent onset or diagnosis of 10 physical conditions (as shown above), all associations were **statistically significant** – meaning all diseases/conditions showed significant prevalence across all SUD/MHD diagnoses.
* Individuals who gained additional SUD and or MHD diagnoses over their life course were associated with increasing odds of subsequent diagnosis of any of the 10 physical conditions (arthritis, any chronic pain, heart disease, stroke, hypertension, diabetes, asthma, chronic lung disease, peptic ulcer, and cancer).

[Text box on the right]
An important role for the SUD counselor is to connect clients with the healthcare resources they want and that meet their needs, including a primary care provider who can support them in developing a plan to manage chronic illness or receive preventive care.
[End of text box]

This data suggests that the detrimental effects of SUDs and MHDs on physical health can accumulate over the life course. If this is the case, then given the early onset of most SUDs and MHDs, and the similarly early development of many chronic physical conditions, treatment of all SUDs/MHDs should optimally include treatments for health and health behaviors, beginning as early in course of treatment for the SUD/MHD.³⁰[Layout: Single column with a header and a right-side graphic element resembling a spiral binding.]

**Alcohol Use**

Problematic alcohol use in the U.S. is a significant health and social issue, with wide-ranging effects on the body and society. It is a major contributor to injuries, mortality (death), and the burden of disease. Because alcohol tops the list of widely used substances, it needs additional focus. Consider these compelling statistics from the 2022 *National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH)*:

» 61.2 million people ages 12 and older (21.7% in this age group) reported binge drinking in the past month.³¹
» 16.1 million people ages 12 and older (5.7% in this age group) reported heavy alcohol use in the past month.³² That means...
    › For men, consuming five or more drinks on any day or 15 or more per week.
    › For women, consuming four or more drinks on any day or 8 or more per week.
» 29.5 million people ages 12 and older (10.5% in this age group) had alcohol use disorder (AUD) in the past year; of this number, 753,000 were youth ages 12 to 17 (2.9% in this age group) who had AUD in the past year.³³

The number of physiological systems affected by alcohol is staggering both in the scope of medical consequences and in terms of the economics of medical treatment of alcohol-related disorders. Alcohol causes over 200 health issues and around 178,000 deaths annually in the U.S., making it a leading preventable cause of death.³⁴ Most of these deaths are due to long-term heavy drinking or injuries while drunk. Even small amounts of alcohol can increase health risks, like cancer. Recent studies show that alcohol use was found to be linked causally to many disease and injury categories, with more than 40 disease categories being fully attributable to it. Most showed direct relationships with volume of alcohol use—the more alcohol consumed, the higher the risk of disease or death.³⁵ Excessive alcohol use (binge and heavy use) has **immediate effects** that increase the risk of many harmful health conditions. These are most often the result of binge drinking and include the following:

» Injuries, such as motor vehicle crashes, falls, drownings, and burns.
» Violence, including homicide, suicide, sexual assault, and intimate partner violence.
» Alcohol poisoning, a medical emergency that results from high blood alcohol levels.
» Risky sexual behaviors, including unprotected sex or sex with multiple partners. These behaviors can result in unintended pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV.
» Miscarriage and stillbirth or fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) among pregnant women.³⁶

CHAPTER 3: Co-Occurring Conditions and Special Populations
99

Heavy alcohol consumption has been linked to many long-term effects and the increased risk and incidence of
serious diseases. Here are several examples.

» **Liver:** Alcohol primarily affects the liver, causing diseases like fatty liver, inflammation, and cirrhosis,
which can lead to liver failure and the need for transplants. The most serious form of liver damage
is **cirrhosis**. This irreversible liver disease is characterized by scarring and cell death. Chronic alcohol
consumption induces liver fibrosis (scarring) by stimulating the fat-storing cells of the liver to
differentiate into collagen-producing stellate cells. It is believed this leads to irreversible cirrhosis.³⁷

» **Alcohol-Associated Hepatitis (AH)** is a clinical syndrome that develops suddenly in approximately 20%
of people who drink heavily. AH is characterized by a rapid onset of jaundice, liver synthetic dysfunction,
and hepatic decompensation. An episode of AH is frequently the first clinical presentation of advanced
liver disease. About 10% to 20% of people with AH are likely to progress to cirrhosis annually, and 10% of
the individuals with AH have regression of liver injury with abstinence.³⁸

» **Endocrine System:** Heavy alcohol use can disrupt the endocrine system, which includes glands like the
thyroid and adrenal glands, as well as other hormone-producing parts of the body such as the pancreas
and fat tissue. This can lead to hormonal imbalances and interfere with how hormones communicate
with the nervous and immune systems. These disruptions can contribute to the development of diabetes.
Additionally, heavy drinking can increase the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes through several factors,
such as gaining weight, higher levels of blood fats, increased blood pressure, and reduced sensitivity to
insulin—all of which are risk factors for diabetes.³⁹

» **Central Nervous System:** The central nervous system is a major target for adverse effects of alcohol and
when used extensively promotes the development of a significant number of neurological diseases such as
stroke, brain tumor, multiple sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
(ALS). Heavy alcohol use over time damages the brain through a combination of direct neurotoxic effects,
nutritional deficiencies, neuroinflammation, liver disease, and metabolic abnormalities, all made worse
by aging. Brain damage due to alcohol can manifest in problems with attention, memory, and reasoning.
Abstinence may partially reverse these changes.⁴⁰

» **Cardiovascular Diseases:** Excessive alcohol consumption can seriously harm heart health. While
moderate drinking might slightly reduce the risk of some heart diseases, heavy and frequent drinking can
lead to several heart problems. Alcohol can damage the heart muscle, raise blood pressure, and increase
the risk of heart failure and stroke. It can also harm different body tissues, cause various physical
changes, and disrupt hormone levels and chemical processes in the body. Long-term heavy drinking
is known to cause high blood pressure, heart muscle disease, irregular heartbeats, heart failure, heart
attacks, heart muscle disorders, reduced blood flow to the heart, and strokes.⁴¹

» **Cancer:** There is a strong scientific consensus that alcohol drinking can cause several types of cancer.
Alcohol use increases the risk of cancers of the liver, colon, rectum, mouth, pharynx, larynx, esophagus,
and female breast. It has been found to have a "dose-response relationship”, indicating that as alcohol
consumption levels increased, the risk of cancer also increases for most cancer types.⁴² Alcohol can
increase cancer risk through it byproducts and can also damage the liver, which can lead to inflammation
and cirrhosis, or scarring of the liver.⁴³

To summarize, alcohol's impact is vast, affecting multiple body systems and contributing to significant health
risks. Thus, it is important to be aware that developing or worsening medical conditions in many clients may
reflect an unrecognized alcohol problem. The health risks reinforce the need for regular alcohol screening for all
clients, and, when warranted, SUD counselors can use brief interventions to raise their clients' awareness about
their specific alcohol-related health consequences, which may help motivate them to cut back or quit as needed.[Layout: Single column page with a header. A decorative element, resembling the ends of matches in a matchbook, runs down the right margin of the page.]

**Tobacco Use**⁴⁴

Cigarette smoking is the leading preventable cause of premature death in the U.S.⁴⁵ More than 16 million
Americans are living with a disease caused by smoking. Like alcohol, smoking harms nearly every organ in the
body and increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, lung diseases, and many types of cancer. Although smoking
is widespread, it’s more common in certain groups, including men, American Indians/Alaska Natives, **people
with behavioral health conditions**, LGBTQI+ people, and people with lower incomes and education levels.⁴⁶

Smoking rates in people with SUDs, as well as people with MHDs, are two to four times that of the general
population. Smokers with SUDs take up smoking at an early age, consume more cigarettes per day, frequently
use different tobacco products⁴⁷, and have a two to five times lower likelihood of cessation.⁴⁸ In addition,
smoking is much more common among adults with MHDs than those without. In fact, in 2020, 23.1% of U.S.
adults with any MHD reported smoking cigarettes during the past month compared to 14.5% of adults with no
mental health conditions. Overall, approximately 1 in 4 (or 25%) of adults in the U.S. have some form of MHD or
SUD and **these adults consume almost 40% of all cigarettes smoked by adults**.⁴⁹

For every person who dies because of smoking, at least 30 people live with a serious smoking-related illness.
Smoking causes lung diseases such as chronic bronchitis and emphysema, and it has been found to exacerbate
asthma symptoms in adults and children. Cigarette smoking is the most significant risk factor for chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Smoking also substantially increases the risk of heart disease, including
stroke, heart attack, vascular disease, and aneurysm. Cardiovascular disease is responsible for 40% of all
smoking-related deaths. Smoking causes coronary heart disease, the leading cause of death in the U.S. Smoking
is also linked to many other major health conditions—including rheumatoid arthritis, inflammation, and
impaired immune function.⁵⁰

Tobacco use is also a significant contributor to cancer. It can cause not only lung cancer — but also cancers of
the mouth and throat, voice box, esophagus, stomach, kidney, pancreas, liver, bladder, cervix, colon and rectum,
and a type of leukemia. Each year, 660,000 people in the U.S. are diagnosed with and 343,000 people die from
a cancer related to tobacco use.⁵¹ Foremost among the cancers caused by tobacco use is lung cancer. Smoking
increases lung cancer risk five to tenfold, with greater risk among heavy smokers.⁵² Cigarette smoking is not the
only form of tobacco use associated with cancers. Smokeless tobacco has been linked to cancer of the pharynx,
esophagus, stomach, and lung, as well as to colorectal cancer.

Tobacco use, in the context of comorbidity with MHDs and SUDs, creates a significant challenge as it has
such an impact on the overall well-being and health outcomes of affected individuals. The data highlights the
intertwined nature of tobacco use, mental health, and physical diseases, emphasizing the necessity for integrated
care approaches that address smoking cessation as part of the overall treatment strategy.

**HIV**⁵³

Over one million people in the U.S. are living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).⁵⁴ **HIV is a retrovirus
that infects a type of white blood cell called CD4+ T-cells**. It attacks cells that help the body fight infection,
making a person more vulnerable to other infections and diseases. HIV is spread by contact with certain bodily
fluids of a person with HIV, most commonly during unprotected sex (sex without a condom or HIV medicine
to prevent or treat HIV), or through sharing injection drug equipment. If left untreated, HIV can lead to the
disease AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). In the U.S., most people with HIV do not develop AIDS because
HIV medicine taken as prescribed stops the progression of the disease. People who take HIV medicine (called
antiretroviral therapy or ART) as prescribed and achieve an undetectable viral load can **live long and healthy
lives, and will not transmit HIV to their HIV-negative partners through sex**.⁵⁵

HIV can affect anyone regardless of sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, gender, age, or where they live. However,
groups of people in the U.S. are more likely to get HIV than others because of certain factors. Substance use
increases the vulnerability to HIV through several mechanisms. First, it can impair judgment and lead to[Layout: The page has a header with the chapter title on the left and page number on the right. Below the header, there is a large image. The main text content is in a single column below the image. A distinct text box is embedded within the main text on the right side.]

CHAPTER 3: Co-Occurring Conditions and Special Populations 101

risky sexual behaviors, increasing the likelihood of HIV transmission. Second, specific modes of substance
use, particularly injection drug use, provide a direct pathway for HIV transmission through the sharing of
contaminated needles and other injection equipment. Furthermore, the social environments often associated
with problematic substance use, such as poverty, marginalization, and limited access to healthcare, contribute to
the increased risk of HIV exposure.⁵⁶

The opioid epidemic has been escalating for over a decade in the U.S.
Issues stemming from the opioid epidemic have led to an increased
prevalence of people who inject drugs (PWID), which further contributes
to recent increases in HIV cases. Individuals with HIV/AIDS also
constitute a susceptible group adversely affected by problematic or
long-term opioid use. They are known to suffer from HIV-related pain
and are commonly treated with opioids, leading to subsequent opioid
use disorders.⁵⁷ There has been a noticeable shift in the demographics of
new HIV diagnoses among PWID. An increase in diagnoses is observed
among White individuals, young people aged 13–34, and residents outside
large central metropolitan areas, highlighting a change in the epidemic’s
geography and affected populations.⁵⁸ Despite the availability of multiple
evidence-based interventions to treat opioid use disorder and prevent HIV
acquisition, significant barriers hinder the delivery of these solutions to
many PWID. These include stigma, discriminatory policies, and lack of
comprehensive healthcare access.

Opioid use disorder (OUD) and
infectious diseases are intertwined
epidemics.⁵⁹ In the 1980s, it was
realized that human HIV could be
transmitted via injection drug use.
Today, infectious diseases linked to
OUD include HIV and hepatitis A, B,
and C viruses, as well as bacterial,
fungal, and other infections.

For individuals living with HIV who experience a co-occurring SUD, effective SUD treatment improves both HIV-
and SUD-related health outcomes.⁶⁰ However, people with both HIV and SUDs may delay HIV treatment initiation
and underuse SUD treatment; therefore, personally-tailored and integrated services are necessary to achieve
both HIV- and SUD-related treatment goals. SUD treatment programs need to be well-equipped to provide HIV
risk assessments, testing, counseling, and linkage to HIV care providers. They should also provide PrEP (pre-
exposure prophylaxis) and PEP (post-exposure prophylaxis) prescriptions for those who do not have HIV to
reduce their risk of contracting HIV.

While there are many considerations when treating SUDs among people with HIV, many approaches have been
found effective for addressing these complexities and challenges. Providers should:[Layout: Single column with a header. The header contains the page number on the left and the document title on the right.]

102 IC&RC Alcohol and Drug Counselor (ADC) Certification Examination Study Guide

1.  Offer universal HIV screenings for people experiencing SUD.

2.  Make medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) available to help reduce the incidence of injection drug use.

3.  Implement ongoing HIV screenings and testing, prescribe PrEP and PEP, provide education on harm reduction strategies (e.g., condom use, not sharing needles), and implement counseling programs to support continued SUD recovery and prevent HIV for clients experiencing SUD who are not living with HIV.

4.  Link clients who are living with HIV to primary care.

5.  Develop treatment plans that integrate comprehensive care to address both conditions simultaneously and holistically.

6.  Ensure case management services are available for coordinated care, access to resources, and support. This includes having a network of referral sources for services not provided within the organization, including medical care, mental health, and social/recovery supports.

In summary, HIV testing, counseling, and linkage to care, particularly among people who inject drugs, is crucially important not only to the health of the individual but also as a means of decreasing HIV transmission.

**Viral Hepatitis**⁶¹, ⁶²

Tens of thousands of new cases of viral hepatitis occur every year in the U.S. Viral hepatitis is a serious public health threat that kills thousands of Americans annually and is a leading cause of liver cancer. Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver. It can be caused by a variety of toxins (such as drugs or alcohol), autoimmune conditions, or pathogens (including viruses, bacteria, or parasites).

Hepatitis is caused by different viruses, known as **hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E**. Each strain has distinct characteristics, modes of transmission, and geographic prevalence. Left untreated, hepatitis can lead to cirrhosis of the liver. It can also lead to a type of liver cancer called hepatocellular carcinoma.

» **Hepatitis A Virus (HAV)** is a vaccine-preventable disease caused by infection of the liver with the hepatitis A virus (HAV). HAV is usually transmitted person to person through the fecal–oral route or through consumption of contaminated food or water. Hepatitis A is a self-limited disease that does not result in chronic infection. Treatment for HAV infection might include rest, adequate nutrition, and fluids. Vaccination can prevent HAV infection.

» **Hepatitis B Virus (HBV):** Hepatitis B is a vaccine-preventable disease caused by infection of the liver with the hepatitis B virus (HBV). HBV is transmitted when blood, semen, or another body fluid from a person infected with the virus enters the body of someone who is uninfected. This can happen through sexual contact; sharing needles, syringes, or other drug-injection equipment; or from the gestational parent to baby during pregnancy or at birth. For some people, hepatitis B is an acute, or short-term, illness; for others, it can become a long-term, chronic infection. Chronic hepatitis B can lead to serious health problems, including cirrhosis, liver cancer, and death. A vaccination available and recommended.

» **Hepatitis C Virus (HCV):** Hepatitis C is a disease caused by infection of the liver with the hepatitis C virus (HCV). HCV is a bloodborne virus. Transmission can happen through sharing needles, syringes, or other drug-injection equipment; from the gestational parent to baby during pregnancy or at birth; or (rarely) through sexual contact. Since 2012, there have been more deaths due to hepatitis C than all 60 of the other reportable infectious diseases combined.

Today, in the U.S., the majority of people become infected with HCV by sharing needles or other equipment used to inject drugs. For certain people, hepatitis C is a short-term illness, but for aboutCHAPTER 3: Co-Occurring Conditions and Special Populations 103

half of persons who become infected with HCV, it becomes a long-term, chronic infection. Like chronic hepatitis B, chronic hepatitis C is a serious disease that can result in cirrhosis, liver cancer, and death. People might not be aware of their infection if they do not have symptoms. Since 2013, highly effective, well-tolerated curative treatments have been available for hepatitis C, but no vaccine for preventing hepatitis C is yet available.

» **Hepatitis D Virus (HDV):** Hepatitis D, also known as “delta hepatitis,” is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis D virus (HDV). Hepatitis D only occurs in people who are also infected with the hepatitis B virus. Hepatitis D is spread when blood or other body fluids from a person infected with the virus enters the body of someone who is not infected. Hepatitis D can be an acute, short-term infection or become a long-term, chronic infection. Hepatitis D can cause severe symptoms and serious illness that can lead to life-long liver damage and even death. There is no vaccine to prevent hepatitis D. However, prevention of hepatitis B with hepatitis B vaccine also protects against future hepatitis D infection.

» **Hepatitis E Virus (HEV)** is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis E virus (HEV). HEV is found in the stool of an infected person. It is spread when someone unknowingly ingests the virus – even in microscopic amounts. Symptoms of hepatitis E can include fatigue, poor appetite, stomach pain, nausea, and jaundice. However, many people with hepatitis E, especially young children, have no symptoms. Most people recover fully from the disease without any complications. No vaccine for hepatitis E is currently available in the U.S.

**THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SUBSTANCE USE AND VIRAL HEPATITIS**

Drug and alcohol use places people at particular risk for contracting viral hepatitis. Engaging in risky sexual behavior that often accompanies substance use increases the risk of contracting HBV and, less frequently, HCV. People who inject drugs (PWID) are at high risk for contracting HBV and HCV from shared needles and other drug preparation equipment, which exposes them to bodily fluids from other infected people. Because substance use often impairs judgement, PWID repeatedly engage in these unsafe behaviors.63

People with hepatitis who inject drugs often have several other health conditions at the same time, including MHDs and HIV/AIDS, thus requiring care from multiple healthcare providers. SUD counselors and other healthcare providers can play a crucial role in combating hepatitis among their clients through:

1.  **Education and Awareness:** Educate clients about the risks of hepatitis, modes of transmission, and the importance of preventive measures. This includes information on safe injection practices, the risks of sharing needles, and the benefits of using sterile equipment.
2.  **Screening and Testing:** Encourage and facilitate regular screening and testing for hepatitis B and C. Early detection can lead to timely treatment and reduce the risk of severe liver disease and other complications.
3.  **Vaccination:** Advocate for and assist in obtaining vaccinations against hepatitis A and B for clients, as there is no vaccine for hepatitis C.
4.  **Referral to Medical Care:** Connect clients with hepatitis to healthcare services for further evaluation, monitoring, and treatment. Effective antiviral treatments are available for both hepatitis B and C, which can manage the infection and reduce the risk of liver damage.
5.  **Harm Reduction Services:** Provide or refer clients to harm reduction services, such as needle exchange programs and supervised injection facilities, to reduce the risk of hepatitis transmission.
6.  **Supportive Services:** Offer or coordinate access to supportive services, such as mental health counseling, housing assistance, and job training, which can improve overall well-being and reduce behaviors that contribute to the risk of hepatitis.
7.  **Integrated Care:** Work towards integrating SUD treatment with primary healthcare services to ensure a comprehensive approach to the client’s health, including the management of hepatitis and other comorbid conditions.104 IC&RC Alcohol and Drug Counselor (ADC) Certification Examination Study Guide

**Sexually Transmitted Diseases**

Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and infections (STIs) represent a significant public health challenge globally, affecting individuals’ health, well-being, and social relationships. The most prevalent STDs include chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, herpes, human papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis B, HIV, and trichomoniasis, with varying incidences and impacts across different populations and geographical regions.

[Layout: The page has a main text area on the left and a sidebar on the right. The main text area contains paragraphs and bullet points. The sidebar contains a text box with a heading.]

The CDC’s report—**Sexually Transmitted Infections Surveillance, 2022**—provides the most current and complete U.S. national data for STIs. This report underscores that STIs must be a public health priority.⁶⁴

» More than 2.5 million cases of syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia were reported. Syphilis cases (all stages and congenital syphilis) have increased 80% in the past five years with more than 3,700 cases of congenital syphilis reported. Congenital syphilis is a serious, preventable condition transmitted from an infected mother to her baby during pregnancy. This disease can have severe outcomes, ranging from asymptomatic infection to multisystem disease or even death.

» Chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis are highly prevalent among young adults and adolescents in the U.S. These infections can lead to serious health consequences if untreated. Some declines in STIs were noted in the report—gonorrhea cases declined for the first time in at least a decade while reported chlamydia cases were level.

» Viral STDs like HPV, herpes simplex virus (HSV), and HIV are also prevalent, with HPV being particularly noteworthy due to its asymptomatic nature and potential to cause genital warts and cervical cancer. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a group of more than 200 related viruses, with more than 40 types easily spread through direct sexual contact, from the skin and mucous membranes of infected people to those of their partners. Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) is associated with genital herpes and can increase susceptibility to other STDs, including HIV.

This report also showed that there were significant disparities among population groups in reported STIs.

» In 2022, half (49.8%) of reported cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis (all stages) were among adolescents and young adults aged 15–24 years.

» Men who have sex with men (MSM) are disproportionally impacted by STIs, including gonorrhea and P&S syphilis. Co-infection with HIV is common; 36.4% of MSM who had P&S syphilis were also diagnosed with HIV.

» Thirty-one percent (31.1%) of all cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and P&S syphilis were among non-Hispanic Black or African American people, even though they made up only 12.6% of the US population.

The CDC suggests that the differences in STI rates are likely due to unequal access to quality sexual health care and variations in sexual network characteristics, not necessarily differences in sexual behavior. For instance, in areas with more STIs, people have a higher risk of encountering an infected partner during sexual activity, regardless of how similarly they behave compared to those in areas with fewer STIs. Recognizing these disparities and their underlying causes is essential for enabling affected groups and public health experts to work together to address these systemic issues, aiming to reduce the impact of STIs on individuals and communities.

[Sidebar Text]
**STD or STI?**

A **sexually transmitted infection (STI)** is a virus, bacteria, fungus, or parasite people can get through sexual contact. Many STIs have no symptoms, so people can have an infection but not know it.

A **sexually transmitted disease (STD)** develops because of an STI and the term implies that the infection has led to some symptom of disease. People sometimes use the terms in one another’s place, but the preferred term today is STI.
[End Sidebar Text]CHAPTER 3: Co-Occurring Conditions and Special Populations 105

Individuals with SUDs are at heightened risk for contracting and transmitting sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Like HIV and viral hepatitis, engaging in risky sexual behavior that often accompanies substance use and injection drug use increases the risk for STIs. In addition, studies have shown that young adults who used an illicit drug were three times more likely to get an STI, and among teens there is an association between substance use and sexual risk behaviors such as ever having sex, having multiple sex partners, not using a condom, and pregnancy before the age of 15 years of age.⁶⁵

Individuals who are involved in the sex trade are particularly vulnerable to HIV and STIs due to high-risk behaviors compounded by substance use. Street-based sex workers often have complex health and social needs due to high prevalence of heroin, cocaine, and injection drug use, poor treatment outcomes, high levels of mental and physical health conditions, and exposure to sexual and physical violence and homelessness.⁶⁶ Sex workers, particularly those with SUDs, may have reduced capacity to negotiate safer sex practices and are often pressured to engage in unprotected sex by clients offering higher payments or drugs.⁶⁷ The criminalization of both sex work and drug use, and the stigmatization of sex workers who use drugs, hinders the delivery of effective and accessible services, including SUD treatment.

Most of the same strategies used to address HIV and viral hepatitis (harm reduction, education, screening, referral to medical care, etc.) can be used proactively to prevent sexually transmitted infection/disease (STI/STD) acquisition and transmission. Specific strategies to address STIs include:⁶⁸

1.  **Screening:** Screening should occur for all sexually active adolescents and for adults at increased risk for STIs. Adults at increased risk for STIs include those who currently have an STI or were diagnosed with one within the past year, do not consistently use condoms, have multiple sex partners, or have sex partners within populations with a high prevalence of STIs. Attention to screening needs to be proactive with populations with a high prevalence of STIs—persons who seek STI testing or attend STI clinics; sexual and gender minorities; persons who are living with HIV, inject drugs, have exchanged sex for money or drugs, or have entered correctional facilities; and some racial/ethnic minority groups.
2.  **Behavioral Sexual Risk-Reduction Counseling:** Counseling strategies are relevant for both adults and adolescents, however, all sexually active adolescents are at increased risk for STIs and should receive behavioral counseling interventions. The most successful approaches are to provide information on common STIs and STI transmission; assess the person’s risk for acquiring STIs; aim to increase motivation or commitment to safer sex practices; and provide training in condom use, communication about safer sex, problem solving, and other pertinent skills.

**SPECIAL POPULATIONS**

The SUD treatment field is continually evolving to increase responsiveness to the unique requirements of diverse
groups like women, youth, older adults, people with CODs, people who identify as LGBTQI+, people who are
criminal justice involved, veterans, and others. Treatment methods have become more refined, adaptable, and
comprehensive. Providers now tailor treatments to fit the specific needs of each client, moving away from a
one-size-fits-all approach. This shift towards customized care is a natural progression of established treatment
philosophies, underlining the need for practitioners to possess the skills and knowledge to adjust programs to
suit client-specific needs effectively.

Entry-level SUD counselors are not expected to have in-depth knowledge about every population group; however,
they should have a fundamental understanding of the needs of diverse groups of people in treatment for several
reasons.

» **Individualized Treatment:** Understanding the unique backgrounds, cultures, and experiences of diverse
groups enables counselors to provide individualized treatment plans that are more effective and
responsive to each client’s specific needs.

» **Cultural Competence:** Knowledge of different cultural, racial, and ethnic backgrounds helps counselors
build rapport and trust with clients. Cultural responsiveness can improve communication and foster a
therapeutic alliance, which is crucial for successful outcomes in treatment.

» **Addressing Disparities:** Awareness of how social, economic, and cultural factors contribute to problematic
substance use and treatment disparities allows counselors to address these issues proactively. This can
lead to more equitable treatment services and better health outcomes for marginalized groups.

» **Enhanced Outcomes:** Counselors who are educated about the specific needs of diverse people can adapt
their approaches to be more inclusive and sensitive, leading to better client engagement and treatment
outcomes.

» **Ethical Practice:** It is part of the ethical responsibility of SUD counselors to understand and respect
the diversity of clients. This includes being aware of their personal biases and how these can impact
treatment.

» **Continuous Learning and Improvement:** The field of SUD treatment is constantly evolving. Counselors
who are knowledgeable about diverse populations are better equipped to learn from a wide range of client
experiences, contributing to ongoing professional development and improvement of the field.

SAMHSA has produced numerous Technical Assistance (TIP) publications that delve in-depth into the treatment
needs and recommended practices for specific types of disorders (MHDs, HIV/AIDS) and/or specific population
groups (women, adolescents, older adults, persons in the criminal justice system, etc.). This section provides
brief highlights of the treatment considerations for several groups; however, it is prohibitive to try to address
every special population. Users of this study guide are encouraged to access the many free resources that are
available through federal initiatives (e.g., SAMHSA, NIDA, NIAAA, NIMH, CDC) and their sponsored training and
technical assistance centers to advance their knowledge and skills for many special population groups.CHAPTER 3: Co-Occurring Conditions and Special Populations 107

**Women/Pregnant Women**

Women with SUDs have unique biopsychosocial needs that should be addressed if their treatment is to be successful. Extensive research indicates there are notable differences in the prevalence, origin, comorbidities, and treatment responses to SUDs between men and women. These differences are attributed to a range of biological, genetic, environmental, and behavioral factors. Prevalence rates for SUDs vary widely based on substance types, with alcohol use disorders being reported most often for both men and women. Polysubstance use is common in both genders, although it is reported more frequently in men. In the most recent data shows that the gender gap in substance use prevalence and SUDs is narrowing.⁶⁹

The reasons for initiation of substance use and the subsequent development of SUDs involve a network of factors among women. No biopsychosocial characteristic is solely responsible for substance initiation or progression to the development of an SUD. In general, women (relative to their male counterparts), may have an accelerated course of substance use, progressing more rapidly from initiation of substance use to problems with substances, and from problematic substance use to treatment.⁷⁰ This progression is referred to as a “telescoping” course of illness.⁷¹ While women have a greater biological vulnerability to the adverse consequences of substance use, it is important to note that variations in progression and the consequences of substance use may also be linked to socioeconomic status, racial/ethnic differences, and age.⁷²

**FACTORS THAT HINDER ACCESS TO TREATMENT AND RECOVERY**

From initiation to the development of an SUD, women often follow different pathways. These pathways are influenced by many factors such as stigma, relationships, on-going trauma and interpersonal violence, barriers to treatment-seeking and engagement, and lack of social support for recovery among women.73

**Stigma.** The stigma that surrounds women who have problematic substance use/SUDs is not singular. It consists of multiple overlapping stigmas which can include stigma around SUDs, harm reduction approaches, substance type, gender, race, and economic status. Stigma and shame associated with SUDs results in a reduced chance that the individual will seek treatment; influences the kinds of treatment people are willing to accept; and affects treatment retention as well as the individual’s ability to maintain a recovery-oriented lifestyle.74

Women are stigmatized more than men for using alcohol and other drugs because they are perceived as going against their gender roles and characteristics of perceived female identity. The stigma of substance use is also greater for mothers since they are expected to be the caregivers, raise children, and be more family oriented than fathers.75 The internalization of stigma can exacerbate guilt and shame, while discriminatory and gender-blind services may deter help-seeking.76 Pregnant and parenting women using substances face particular societal criticism. Pregnant women often delay seeking services with serious implications for the mother and the fetus.

**Interpersonal Violence and Trauma.** A history of traumatic events including, but not limited to, sexual and physical assaults, childhood sexual and physical abuse, and domestic violence, are significantly associated with initiation of substance use and the development of SUDs among women.77 A high proportion of women with SUDs have histories of trauma, often perpetrated by persons they both knew and trusted. Research shows that histories of trauma put women at increased risk of co-occurring disorders and these disorders present with more severe symptoms and precipitate worse outcomes for women than those with either MHDs or SUDs alone.78

The actual introduction to substances by a significant other is not uncommon and is often their way of increasing control and establishing power over the woman. This type of coercion is considered a form of intimate partner violence (IPV) which includes such tactics as forcing a partner to use substances or to use more than they want; controlling or interfering with a partner’s SUD treatment; or undermining a partner’s recovery.79 A recent systematic review of the literature stressed the significant relationship between IPV and subsequent substance use, SUD diagnoses, and poorer treatment outcomes.80

**Relationships.** From a sociocultural perspective, women (more than men) tend to define themselves in terms of their webs of social relationships and obligations. Relationships with others have special significance for many women. Women are more likely to be introduced to and initiate alcohol and drug use through significant relationships including boyfriends, spouses, partners, and family members. This influence does not stop with initiation; it extends to greater use and higher incidence of SUDs when they have partners who problematically use substances.81

Problematic substance use can affect a women’s connections and relationships, causing them to leave or abandon many of the relational systems on which they formerly depended—family, friends, and roots in the community. Psychological differences between men and women, and the heightened importance that women place on relationships, greatly influence a woman’s gateway into problematic substance use and into a recurrence of use once during recovery. In addition, a woman’s focus within relationships is often to serve as caretaker, a role that can result in a woman’s not attending to her own needs. Positive, therapeutic relationships, however, can act as powerful tools for supporting a woman’s recovery.82

**Co-occurring Physical and Mental Health Conditions.** Women with SUD have greater susceptibility to, as well as earlier onset of serious medical problems. They often have a range of health concerns and chronic health problems that require prevention, primary care, gynecological, and other specialized services. For example, women who use alcohol heavily can develop cirrhosis and heart muscle and nerve damage with fewer years of heavy drinking in comparison to men. Likewise, illicit drug use is associated with greater risk for liver and kidney diseases, bacterial infections, and opportunistic diseases.83[Image: A black and white, grainy photograph of a person, likely a woman, viewed from the side and slightly above.

CHAPTER 3: Co-Occurring Conditions and Special Populations 109

Routine gynecological care is fundamental to the prevention or early detection of a variety of serious health problems, including cervical, breast, and other cancers; HIV/AIDS, STIs, and other infectious diseases; infertility, early onset of menopause; and complications during pregnancy and birth. In addition, women who use alcohol or other drugs may not realize they are pregnant. They may mistakenly associate early signs of pregnancy as symptoms related to use or withdrawal from substances and do not begin prenatal care until well into their pregnancies. Some of the most negative effects of substance use on the developing embryo can occur in the first weeks of pregnancy.

Many women with SUDs are also diagnosed with MHDs. In 2022, 11.1 million women reporting an SUD also reported any MHD in the past year.⁸⁴ Women are more likely to experience certain MHDs, such as depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and eating disorders.⁸⁵ The presence of comorbid PTSD is high and primarily due to the experience of trauma exposure related to intimate partner violence, sexual assault, and childhood abuse. Some women report using substances to relieve stress or negative emotions. In addition, women are more vulnerable to developing SUDs or other MHDs following divorce, loss of child custody, or the death of a partner or child. Untreated MHDs among mothers increases the risk for substance use and negatively affect mothers’ ability to care for and respond to their babies.⁸⁶

Women with SUDs also report poorer overall quality of life compared with men.⁸⁷ They are more likely to experience other adverse health outcomes including violence, and particularly IPV.⁸⁸ Problematic substance use in women has been associated with sexual assault, unintended pregnancy, engagement in risky sexual behavior, physical injury, and overdose.⁸⁹ Furthermore, some women who use drugs engage in sex work as a means to obtain drugs or for financial support. Street-based sex workers have complex health and social issues due to high prevalence of injection drug use, poor treatment outcomes, high levels of morbidity and mortality for mental and physical health outcomes, exposure to violence, and homelessness.⁹⁰[Layout: Single column of text with a header at the top.

**Socio-economic factors.** Challenging life situations and barriers that influence SUDs and MHDs among women often considerably overlap with negative social determinants of health. Women with SUDs may have access to less social support than men which may play a central role in their substance use and recovery. They are particularly likely to: experience economic disadvantage and have less social support; come from families with substance use problems and have a substance-using partner; and have children and be responsible for their care.⁹¹ In general, women with SUDs have less education and employment experience than men with SUDs placing them in a position to rely on men or other family members or turn to sex work for financial support.⁹²,⁹³ In addition, the cost of SUD treatment may be a barrier if services are not provided by the state and there is no insurance coverage.

**Treatment Seeking.** Women are more likely to seek SUD treatment through general healthcare settings or mental health clinics rather than specialized SUD treatment centers. Women often seek treatment due to stressful life events and mental health concerns unrelated to substance use. Additional entry points into treatment include welfare, child welfare, and legal systems, although they are less likely to be court-mandated to treatment. Women prefer SUD treatment centers that offer childcare, as this service significantly reduces barriers to treatment engagement by addressing one of the major challenges faced by parents seeking care. However, many women who are pregnant or have young children do not seek treatment or drop out of treatment early. They may fear that authorities will remove their children from their care if they are unable to have their children with them. In addition, many women don’t seek treatment because the combined burdens of work, home care, childcare, and other family responsibilities, plus attending treatment frequently, can be overwhelming.⁹⁴

**PREGNANT WOMEN**

MHDs and SUDs during pregnancy and the postpartum period affect an estimated 1 in 5 individuals annually in the U.S.⁹⁵ Maternal MHDs (e.g., mood disorders, anxiety disorders, trauma-related disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and postpartum psychosis) and SUDs range in type and severity. Preexisting maternal MHDs and SUDs, including serious diagnoses such as schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorders, may be affected by pregnancy and the postpartum period with risk of increased relapses.⁹⁶ When left untreated, maternal MHDs and SUDs can have long-lasting negative effects on individuals and families—with costs estimated to be more than $14 billion a year in the U.S.⁹⁷

Use of substances during pregnancy is increasingly common. The most commonly used substances during pregnancy are alcohol, marijuana, tobacco, and opioids.⁹⁸ In 2022, 10% of pregnant women engaged in binge drinking or used heavy amounts of alcohol, 7.9% reported use of marijuana in the past month (2.8% used marijuana daily), and 4.8% used cigarettes.⁹⁹ A 2019 PRAMS survey data found that 6.6% of women reported prescription opioid use during pregnancy; among these women, 21.2% reported misuse (accessed from a source other than a healthcare provider).¹⁰⁰ Mothers with opioid-related diagnoses documented at delivery increased by 131% between 2010 and 2017, and the incidence of babies born with withdrawal symptoms, or Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome, increased by 82% over the same period.¹⁰¹

The effects of problematic substance use on both the pregnant woman and the developing fetus may be significant. Research shows that use of tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs or misuse of prescription drugs by pregnant women can have severe health consequences for infants. This is because many substances pass easily through the placenta, so substances that a pregnant woman takes also reach the fetus.¹⁰² Adverse effects of problematic substance use on the fetus are similarly wide ranging. Here are some examples.
» Infants with prenatal opioid exposure may be smaller at birth and have Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome (NOWS), a form of Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome, requiring additional medical care.¹⁰³
» Infants born to mothers with problematic alcohol use can have alcohol-related birth defects, including heart, kidney, bone, or hearing problems; alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorders; or Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders.¹⁰⁴
» Infants born to mothers with problematic marijuana use during pregnancy are at higher risk of being born preterm, having low birth weight, or having long-term brain development issues.¹⁰⁵
» Smoking during pregnancy raises the risk of the baby being born too small, too early, or with birth defects. During the first year of life, there is a higher risk of the baby dying from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).¹⁰⁶CHAPTER 3: Co-Occurring Conditions and Special Populations 111

**Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS)**¹⁰⁸

NAS is recognized as a constellation of clinical signs of withdrawal that may occur in neonates after *in utero* exposure to opioids and other substances. It is characterized by signs and symptoms indicating central nervous system hyperirritability, and dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, and respiratory system. In 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration introduced new terminology designating **Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome (NOWS)** as the specific neonatal withdrawal from opioids. The use of this new terminology has become more widespread and NOWS is considered a subset of NAS.

In 2020, expert panels convened to distinguish the differences between NAS and NOWS and provide an accurate and universally applied definition for NOWS. Their findings were published in 2021. The panels identified five of the most common signs that are characteristic of both NAS and NOWS (excessive crying, fragmented sleep, tremors, increased muscle tone, and alterations in feeding) and recommended a universal definition for NOWS:

Clinical criteria for diagnosis of NOWS consist of the presence of clinical elements 1 and 2:
*   (1) **In utero exposure** to opioids with or without other psychotropic substances (recommended to be collected via confidential maternal self-report; toxicology testing also acceptable with maternal informed consent).
*   (2) **Clinical signs** characteristic of substance withdrawal; any 2 of the 5 signs (as listed above).

Regular use of some drugs can cause Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) in which the baby goes through withdrawal at birth. Most research in this area has focused on the effects of opioids (prescription pain relievers or heroin). However, data has shown that use of alcohol, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, and caffeine during pregnancy may also cause the infant to show withdrawal symptoms at birth. The type and severity of an infant’s withdrawal symptoms depend on the drug(s) used, how long and how often the birth mother used, how her body breaks the drug down, and whether the infant was born full term or prematurely.¹⁰⁷

Pregnant and postpartum women are at high risk for fatal opioid overdose, with overdose deaths increasing by 81% from 2017 to 2020. Women with opioid use disorder (OUD) at delivery are 4.6 times more likely to die in the hospital, 3.5 times more likely to have a cardiac arrest, and twice as likely to have premature births, blood transfusions, stillbirths, cesarean sections, and preeclampsia compared to those without OUD. Effective treatment for OUD during pregnancy can improve outcomes for both the mother and baby. However, only 50–60% of pregnant women with OUD receive medication treatment due to significant barriers, such as stigma from healthcare providers, a lack of available treatment providers, legal penalties for disclosing substance use, and the risk of child welfare involvement.¹⁰⁹

Consequences of mental health-related incidents and conditions—which include fatalities from suicide, drug overdoses and poisonings, and certain traumatic experiences, including IPV—now represent the leading cause of pregnancy-related deaths in the U.S.¹¹⁰ Taken together, these incidents accounted for 22.7% of pregnancy-related deaths, according to an analysis of 2017–2019 data from 36 states.¹¹¹ MHDs and/or SUDs were the leading cause of pregnancy-related deaths for White and Hispanic women and the sixth-leading cause of pregnancy-related deaths for Black women (with cardiac and coronary conditions being the leading cause for this group).¹¹² Another study of American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) individuals, in combination with other races, indicated that 31.3% of pregnancy-related deaths were caused by underlying MHDs and SUDs–the leading cause for this group.¹¹³

The postpartum period poses significant challenges, as women often experience intense psychological distress, including anxiety, depression, and perceived stress, compounded by societal expectations. According to the CDC, about 1 in 8 postpartum women suffer from depressive symptoms.¹¹⁴ Risk factors for postpartum depression (PPD) include a history of depression or anxiety during or before pregnancy, postpartum blues, psychosocial112 IC&RC Alcohol and Drug Counselor (ADC) Certification Examination Study Guide

stress (e.g., poor marital relationships, lack of social support, childcare distress), and certain personality traits like neuroticism and low self-esteem.¹¹⁵ Additionally, perinatal PTSD affects 2% to 9% of women after childbirth, with those having previous sexual trauma at higher risk for obstetric complications and PTSD.¹¹⁶, ¹¹⁷ A California study (CA-PAMR) found most perinatal suicides occur in the late postpartum period (43–365 days after birth), with 36% between 43 days and 6 months, and 47% after six months.¹¹⁸

Despite these alarming statistics, more than 75% women with maternal MHDs do not receive treatment.¹¹⁹ Contributing to this can be a “perinatal depression treatment cascade” where most women with postpartum depression do not get adequate treatment and remain depressed. There is also a significant unmet need for treatment of perinatal SUD. One recent study (2024) found that only 12.8% of pregnant women with past-year SUD received treatment.¹²⁰ Despite the rising need for OUD treatment among pregnant and postpartum women, only 23% of U.S. SUD treatment facilities had specialty care programs for opioid treatment¹²¹ and only 5.5% of these facilities provide childcare.¹²² This highlights a significant gap in the availability of targeted care for this vulnerable population.

**IMPLICATIONS FOR WOMEN’S TREATMENT¹²³**

Specialized programs that offer comprehensive, integrated approaches to treatment combining clinical and social services with care coordination and trauma-informed care have been found to be most effective. Research shows that a comprehensive array of services is required, preferably provided in women-only programs with female-specific content which yields the best outcomes.¹²⁴ Six key elements have been linked to successful outcomes in SUD treatment programs for women: childcare, prenatal care, women-only treatment, mental health treatment, a holistic approach, and services addressing women’s needs. These elements are linked to positive treatment results.

While some of these processes are common in any SUD treatment, it’s crucial to recognize the unique combination of general and specific processes effective for women with children. Identifying these gender-specific pathways can improve treatment effectiveness. Women-specific treatments offer greater benefits for psychosocial well-being, mental health, pregnancy outcomes, and risk reduction for infectious diseases compared to gender-neutral treatments. While it is beyond the scope of this study guide to address all issues pertaining to women, it is important to note that treatment considerations must be made for sub-populations of women who experience considerable adversity – such as women experiencing homelessness or incarceration; women who are members of under-resourced racial/ethnic groups; women in the military; LGBTQI+ people; and women experiencing or who have experienced violence/gender-based violence (GBV) and/or other trauma.

Effective treatment and recovery services for women with SUDs and MHDs require a gender-responsive and integrated approach, addressing the unique challenges these women face. The following evidence highlights key components and approaches that have proven effective.

1.  **Engagement:** Emphasizing engagement strategies for women in SUD treatment, especially those who are pregnant or postpartum, is crucial. These women are at high risk for poor health outcomes, including overdose, making effective engagement essential for their safety and well-being. Active engagement efforts should involve not only the women, but their families, personal support networks, communities, and the clinicians and community-based practitioners who serve them.

2.  **Integrated SUD/MHD and Trauma-Informed Services:** Effective SUD treatment and recovery programs should ensure that women can access screening, assessment, and services for MHDs. Programs with integrated treatment for SUD and MHD treatments with a trauma-informed approach are particularly effective. Safety measures in treatment programs, such as trauma-informed care, non-judgmental support, and comprehensive health services, are also important. Effective treatment and recovery services consist of strength-building approaches and avoid punitive strategies that further reduce self-efficacy and engagement.

3.  **Gender-Responsive and Evidence-based Treatment Models:** Effective treatment and recovery services for women must address a wide range of gender-specific needs. Many interventions and supports canCHAPTER 3: Co-Occurring Conditions and Special Populations 113

promote wellness, including specific evidence-based practices and curricula that are highly effective for women. Comprehensive, gender-responsive models like *Seeking Safety*, *Helping Women Recover* and *TREM* have shown effectiveness in addressing co-occurring SUDs and MHDs in women, resulting in better outcomes as compared to standard treatments.125

4.  **Relationships:** Relationships are often of primary importance to women. Effective treatment and recovery services should have well-trained staff members who attend to the therapeutic alliance. Women also benefit from supportive relationships with other women, such as female peer specialists who can share their experiences as well as linkages to mutual self-help groups among female participants and with other community members can further build women’s recovery capital and engagement.

5.  **Holistic and Comprehensive Services:** Addressing socio-economic barriers such as poverty, unemployment, childcare, and housing instability is essential. Integrated treatment programs that offer job training, housing support, and financial assistance can significantly improve recovery outcomes. Women with SUDs/MHDs may qualify for financial assistance programs such as Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), or local general relief programs.

6.  **Physical Health Needs and Sexual and Reproductive Health Services:** Women often fail to attend to healthcare problems while in active substance use, making primary care services for health needs and chronic conditions essential. Sexuality (including sexual orientation) and patterns in a woman’s sexual history are also important considerations in effective treatment services. Women face significant unmet needs in sexual and reproductive health, including high rates of unintended pregnancies and poor access to contraceptive services. Integrated care models that include sexual and reproductive health services (health education, pregnancy planning, STIs, etc.) help in meeting these needs.

7.  **Family and Pregnancy-Oriented Programs:** Women with children entering treatment benefit from parenting skills training, trauma-informed parenting education, family counseling, child development education, access to children’s services, and supports for other family members’ needs. Programs specifically designed for pregnant and postpartum women have demonstrated improved outcomes in SUD/MHD treatment, prenatal and postpartum care, and breastfeeding rates.126

**IMPLICATIONS FOR WOMEN'S PERINATAL (PREGNANCY AND POSTPARTUM) SERVICES¹²⁷**

In addition to the above-listed services, pregnant women and postpartum
women require other linkages to regular perinatal care ensures that these
women receive medical supervision and appropriate treatment throughout
their pregnancy and in the postpartum period. This helps manage both
SUD/MHD and any pregnancy-related complications with substantial
benefits.
» Prenatal care provides essential monitoring and interventions
  that can reduce the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as
  preterm birth, low birth weight, and stillbirth.
» Linking women to prenatal care allows for early identification and
  management of NOWS. Early planning and treatment can reduce
  the severity of withdrawal symptoms in newborns and improve
  neonatal outcomes.
» Prenatal and postnatal care can integrate a comprehensive
  approach that addresses both the medical and psychosocial needs
  of women with SUD. This includes access to counseling, mental
  health services, and social support systems, which are essential for
  recovery and long-term well-being.
» Perinatal care can offer safe and effective pain management
  strategies during labor and postpartum, tailored to women with
  SUD. This reduces the risk of recurrence of use and ensures that
  pain is managed without compromising recovery efforts.
» Linking women to postnatal care ensures continuity of care
  beyond childbirth. This is crucial for monitoring the health of both
  mother and baby, providing ongoing support for breastfeeding,
  mental health, and recovery, and addressing any emerging health
  concerns.
» Perinatal care can connect women with SUD to vital resources such
  as housing, food assistance, and social services. These resources
  are essential for addressing the broader social determinants of
  health that impact recovery and maternal-child health.

For pregnant women who have an OUD, treatment should be delivered in
the context of specialized programs that include providers who are trained
to care for this population and that offer comprehensive services along
with medications that are available to support treatment. SAMHSA, the
American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM)
and the World Health Organization concur that buprenorphine and methadone, when taken as prescribed, are
safe and effective for treating OUD during pregnancy. Buprenorphine is an effective medication that helps
reduce withdrawal symptoms and cravings without producing the same high, making it a safer option during
pregnancy. In addition to effectively treating OUD, these medications can reduce the risk of a recurrence, limit
illicit substance-related effects on the developing fetus, and help prevent the separation of families. The use of
medications for OUD in combination with prenatal care is associated with reduced risk of obstetric complications
as well as positive outcomes for the baby, including increased birth weight and gestational age at delivery.¹²⁸

Recommendations for direct services for pregnant women include:¹²⁹

» **Provide Universal Prenatal SUD Screening:** Screen all pregnant clients for SUDs at the first prenatal visit
  and continue follow-up screenings. The goal is to identify and treat SUD, improving both medical and
  obstetric care. Providers should reassure clients that the purpose of screening is to support health, not to
  punish, and encourae open discussion about substance use.CHAPTER 3: Co-Occurring Conditions and Special Populations 115

» **Prenatal Care:** Offer holistic care that addresses both the health of the mother and the developing fetus.
This includes providing or linking to regular medical check-ups to monitor the pregnancy and manage
any complications, along with mental health services to address co-occurring disorders. Medication-
Assisted Treatment (MAT) should be available when necessary. Pregnant women with OUD should be
informed about buprenorphine and methadone and their safety and effectiveness during pregnancy.
Programs should also include prenatal education, covering nutrition, childbirth preparation, and
parenting skills.

» **Connect Clients with Life-Saving Medications and Harm Reduction Services:** Be familiar with harm
reduction strategies. Naloxone, which can reverse opioid overdoses, should be used if an overdose occurs,
despite potential fetal stress, as recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists
(ACOG). Additionally, providing resources such as HIV and Hepatitis testing, along with vaccinations
(such as Hepatitis B) and appropriate treatments if needed, helps to mitigate further health risks.

» **Postpartum Services:** Ensure women in the postpartum phase receive a range of comprehensive services,
such as regular medical check-ups to monitor the physical health of both mother and baby; post-
discharge follow-up appointments to monitor progress and provide ongoing support; continued mental
health services to address postpartum depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues; continued SUD
treatment and recovery services; parenting classes and other parenting resources; and, ancillary services
and supports through case management.

» **Prepare Clients for Future Healthy Pregnancies:** Offer educational sessions or provide information one-
on-one about the steps to support a healthy pregnancy: how OUD affects a baby; effective treatment
options including medications; the importance of ongoing prenatal care; and managing Neonatal Opioid
Withdrawal Syndrome (NOWS).

By offering these services, SUD treatment programs can provide comprehensive support to postpartum women,
addressing both their recovery and their roles as new mothers.

**Adolescents**

Adolescence is the developmental transition to adulthood that includes rapid changes in the brain and body,
often at different rates and is a time for healthy exploration of identity and learning independence. This life
stage, typically ranging from ages 12 to 18, is characterized by a series of complex tasks that are essential for
healthy physical, psychological/ emotional, social growth. There are significant changes and challenges as
individuals transition from childhood to adulthood which can be stressful because of these rapid changes.¹³⁰, ¹³¹

**Physical Changes**

1.  **Puberty:** Puberty marks the onset of adolescence and is characterized by significant physical
    transformations. In boys, this includes growth spurts, increased muscle mass, deepening of the voice,
    and the development of secondary sexual characteristics such as facial and body hair. In girls, puberty
    involves the development of breasts, the onset of menstruation, and changes in body composition such as
    increased body fat distribution.

2.  **Neurological Development:** The adolescent brain undergoes significant structural changes, including
    synaptic pruning and myelination, which improve cognitive functions such as executive control, decision-
    making, and emotional regulation.

3.  **Hormonal Changes:** Hormonal changes during puberty affect physical development and are responsible
    for the development of secondary sexual characteristics. These changes also influence mood and behavior
    due to the increased production of sex hormones such as testosterone and estrogen.116 IC&RC Alcohol and Drug Counselor (ADC) Certification Examination Study Guide

[Image: A black and white photograph shows a group of seven smiling teenagers, seemingly diverse in ethnicity, huddled together and looking towards the camera. They appear to be outdoors. The image is slightly grainy, typical of a printed photograph in a book. The image is positioned above the main text content.]

Psychological/Emotional Tasks

1.  **Identity Formation:** One of the primary tasks of adolescence is the development of a personal identity. Adolescents explore various roles, values, and beliefs to form a coherent sense of self. This process is influenced by individual experiences, social interactions, and cultural contexts.

2.  **Cognitive Development:** Cognitive abilities such as abstract thinking, problem-solving, and decision-making undergo significant development during adolescence. These skills are essential for academic achievement and personal decision-making.

3.  **Emotional Regulation:** Adolescents must learn to manage and regulate their emotions. This involves understanding and expressing emotions appropriately, which is crucial for mental health and social relationships.

4.  **Risk Management and Decision-Making:** Adolescents are often exposed to various risks, including substance use, unsafe sexual practices, and other risky behaviors. Learning to manage these risks and make informed decisions is critical for their safety and well-being.

5.  **Self-Regulation and Coping Strategies:** Adolescents need to develop effective coping mechanisms and self-regulation skills to handle stress and challenges. This involves both cognitive and behavioral strategies to manage demands and maintain mental health.

Social Tasks

1.  **Autonomy and Independence:** Adolescents gradually seek greater independence from their parents and caregivers. This involves making autonomous decisions and developing a sense of responsibility.

2.  **Social Identity:** Adolescents begin to form their social identity, including understanding their place within various social groups and cultural contexts. This task is closely related to their personal identity development.

3.  **Peer Relationships:** Building and maintaining friendships is a key social task. Peer relationships provide emotional support, opportunities for social learning, and a sense of belonging.CHAPTER 3: Co-Occurring Conditions and Special Populations 117

**4. Technological Proficiency:** While this has not historically been a developmental task, it plays an
important part in social relationships and mental health. With the pervasive role of technology,
adolescents must develop appropriate social media habits and self-regulatory practices in using digital
tools and platforms.132, 133

**Relational Tasks**

**1. Family Relationships:** Maintaining and renegotiating family relationships is critical. Adolescents strive to
balance the need for independence with the need for family support and connection.

**2. Romantic Relationships:** Exploring romantic relationships is another significant task. These relationships
help adolescents understand intimacy, commitment, and the complexities of emotional connections.

**3. Conflict Resolution:** Learning to navigate and resolve conflicts in a healthy manner is essential. This skill
is important for maintaining positive relationships and managing social dynamics.

**ADOLESCENTS AND SUBSTANCE USE**

During the stages of adolescent development, individuals are particularly vulnerable to experimenting with
substances, which can lead to SUDs. Substance use during adolescence is a major concern due to its potential to
disrupt healthy development and lead to long-term adverse consequences. Early alcohol and other drug abuse
correlates with problematic substance use later in life, and the most significant increases in destructive behavior
appear to take place among older teens and young adults.

Consider these overarching statistics (2022) about problematic substance use in adolescents:134
» 2.08 million or 8.33% of 12- to 17-year-olds nationwide reported using drugs in the last month.
» 8.7% of 8th graders have used illicit drugs in the last month.
» 21.3% of 8th graders have tried illicit drugs at least once.
» By the time they’re in 12th grade, 46.6% of teens have tried illicit drugs.
» 11.89 million 18- to 25-year-olds used drugs in the last month.
» 11.2% of overdose deaths are among teens and young adults aged 15 to 24 years.

The 2022 NSDUH presents specific statistics on problematic substance use for individuals aged 12 -17, shown by
the following percentages and population estimates.135

[Table: 4 columns, 10 rows. Column headers are: Substance, Lifetime Use, Past Year Use, Past Month Use. The table lists various substances and the percentage (and sometimes number) of individuals aged 12-17 who have used them in different timeframes.]
| Substance | Lifetime Use | Past Year Use | Past Month Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Alcohol** | 22.3% | 16.7% (4.3 million) | 6.8% (1.8 million) |
| **Tobacco/Vaping** | 20.6% | 14.9% (3.8 million) | 7.3% (1.9 million) |
| **Any Illicit Drug** | 20.9% | 14.6% (3.6 million) | 7.3% (1.8 million) |
| **Marijuana** | 13.5% | 10.9% (2.9 million) | 6.4% (1.6 million) |
| **Cocaine** | 0.3% | 0.1% (40,000) | <0.0% (5,000) |

| **Prescription misuse** | not measured | 2.5% (640,000) | 0.6% (157,000) |
| **Opioids (any)** | not measured | 1.6% (406,000) | 0.5% (117,000) |[Layout: Single column of text with a header at the top.

Although this prevalence of use represents a significant number of adolescents, the Monitoring the Future (MTF) Survey shows this represents a decline in alcohol and drug use. The MTF survey is an ongoing national survey of adolescents (secondary school students) in the U.S. It analyzes the data by grade in school rather than by age and presents historical trends in use by students in those grades. The 2021 MTF survey reported significant decreases in substance use among youth in the year of the pandemic onset. For example, for each grade the declines in past 12-month use of marijuana from 2020 to 2021 were the largest ever recorded by the survey (since 1975 for 12th grade students and since 1991 for 10th and 8th grade students). Record decreases also took place for alcohol use and nicotine vaping, which together with cannabis have been the most common forms of substance use among adolescents in recent years.136

The 2023 MTF Survey reveals that adolescent drug use for common substances has remained low since the pandemic began. Key findings include:
» In 2023, lifetime prevalence of illicit drug use (excluding marijuana) was 8% for 8th graders, 9% for 10th graders, and 12% for 12th graders.
» Marijuana use has shown little change since a significant drop in 2021. Among 12th graders, lifetime daily use was 21% in 1982, fell to 8% by 1992, rose to 19% by 1997, and gradually declined to 12% by 2018, remaining stable in 2023.
» Alcohol use has seen a long-term decline since 2000. From 2001 to 2023, past 12-month prevalence decreased from 73% to 46% in 12th grade, from 65% to 31% in 10th grade, and from 43% to 15% in 8th grade.
» Abstaining from marijuana, alcohol, and nicotine increased among 12th graders, with 62.6% reporting no use in the past month. This percentage for 8th and 10th graders was at 87.0% and 76.9% respectively.

MTF report states that it is possible that these decreases will hold for future years going forward, or, instead, alcohol and drug prevalence levels may bounce back to where they were before the pandemic (as recorded by MTF with the 2020 results) as youth have returned to schools and social environments with peers.

The opioid epidemic, however, has profoundly impacted adolescents, leading to increased rates of SUDs and related adverse outcomes. Adolescents are increasingly exposed to opioids, particularly synthetic opioids like fentanyl. Fentanyl, often mixed with other drugs, has significantly contributed to the rise in overdose deaths among youth. From 2019 to 2020, 90% of youth overdose deaths involved opioids. The annualized rate of drug overdose deaths among adolescents aged 14 to 18 years increased to a current high of 5.49 deaths per 100,000 youth – primarily driven by the increased prevalence of illicitly manufactured fentanyl. Within the past decade, fentanyl-related fatalities increased among youth, with fentanyl identified in 77.14% of adolescent overdose deaths by 2021, compared with 5.76% for prescription opioids and 2.27% for heroin.137, 38

In addition to mortality, substance use during adolescence disrupts healthy development in numerous ways:

» The adolescent brain is particularly vulnerable to the effects of substances due to its ongoing development and maturation. Substance use during adolescence can lead to significant changes in neurotransmitter systems and receptor functions and alteration in brain structure. This disruption affects the brain's reward system, leading to increased addiction risk and behavioral dysfunctions such as impaired decision-making and increased impulsivity. Adolescents may experience long-lasting cognitive deficits, including impaired memory, attention, and executive functions that last into adulthood.139
» Behavioral and psychological changes include a higher risk of developing SUDs later in life and a higher prevalence of MHDs, including depression, anxiety, and antisocial personality disorder. Substance use can also negatively impact emotional regulation and social interactions leading to difficulty in forming healthy relationships and may experience increased social isolation and difficulty in social integration.140[LLM OCR returned no text for this page]120 IC&RC Alcohol and Drug Counselor (ADC) Certification Examination Study Guide

In front of them, on a low table, are a closed book and a glass of liquid.]

A report on mental health prevalence data in 2022 showed that the most diagnosed MHDs among children/ adolescents ages 3–17 years were attention deficit disorder (9.8%), anxiety (9.4%) behavior problems (8.9%), and depression (4.4%).¹⁴⁹ The 2022 NSDUH also reports a variety of mental health-related data for adolescents aged 12 – 17:

» 19.5% (or 4.8 million) had a past year major depressive event (MDE).
» 14.6% (or 3.6 million) had a past year MDE with severe impairment.
» 24.7% (or 6.1 million) had either an MDE or an SUD in the past year.
» 3.7% (or 922,000 adolescents) had **both an MDE and an SUD** in the past year.
» 13.4% (3.4 million) had serious thoughts of suicide in the past year; 6.5% (or 1.7 million) made suicide plans; and 3.7% (or 953,000) attempted suicide.

For SUDs, the 2022 NSDUH also reports a variety of data for adolescents aged 12 – 17:

» Any SUD–8.7% or 2.2 million adolescents
» Alcohol Use Disorder–2.9% or 753,000 adolescents
» Marijuana Use Disorder–5.1% or 1.3 million adolescents
» Cocaine Use Disorder–less than 0.05% or 6,000 adolescents
» Heroin Use Disorder–less than 0.05% or 2,000 adolescents
» Opioid Use Disorder–2.0% or 530,000 adolescents
» Methamphetamine Use Disorder–less than 0.05% or 8,000 adolescents
» Stimulant Use Disorder–1.0% or 259,000 adolescents
» Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Use Disorder–0.5% or 135,000 adolescents¹⁵⁰CHAPTER 3: Co-Occurring Conditions and Special Populations 121

The prevalence of mental health problems and types of disorder are relatively different between genders, with adolescent girls being more prone to experience internalizing disorders such as depressions, anxiety or eating disorders, and boys being more likely to experience externalizing disorders (such as conduct disorder, ADHD).151 The overall level of difficulties with mental health issues during adolescence are significantly higher for girls than boys across a range of mental health problems. Research shows that boys' and girls' emotional difficulties usually begin around 11–12 years of age, then diverge significantly from early to mid-adolescence. Findings suggested that early adolescence is a key period for prevention and intervention activity to reduce escalation in mental health problems, particularly for girls.152

IMPLICATIONS FOR TREATMENT153

For the most positive outcomes among adolescents experiencing SUD-related problems, they must have access to age-appropriate intervention, treatment, recovery, practical support such as life skills training and academic support, and meaningful opportunities for involvement and leadership. Adolescents need programs that address their developmental issues, provide comprehensive and integrated services, involve families, and allow adolescents to remain in the most appropriate, but least restrictive setting. As stated in the women's section, there are many subgroups of adolescents that are beyond the scope of this study guide to explore, such as those involved in the juvenile justice system, in foster care, who inject drugs, who are experiencing homelessness, who have developmental disorders or intellectual disabilities, and others.

1. **Developmentally Appropriate Care.** First and foremost, counselors should be informed about and be able to adjust services to meet the cognitive and developmental level, growth, behavior, values/beliefs, and cultural differences among adolescents. Developmentally appropriate care needs to incorporate the distinct developmental stage of the adolescent and any cognitive, social, emotional, and/or developmental delays or disabilities they may have. It is also important to understand the physical and emotional changes that occur during puberty, which vary by gender.

2. **Focus on Engagement.** Substantial numbers of adolescents in SUD treatment do not return after the first session. Efforts are needed to increase the likelihood of retaining an adolescent in treatment.154 Adolescents are reluctant to seek help for a number of reasons: lack of knowledge regarding the signs of substance use and mental health problems; lack of awareness on how to access the system; fear of breaches in confidentiality; a belief that they can handle their own problems; stigma surrounding mental illness; and previous bad experiences.

   Once the adolescent has entered treatment services, counselors can impact engagement by establishing a strong therapeutic alliance and building rapport with adolescents by showing genuine interest in their lives and concerns. This involves active listening, empathy, and validating their experiences (explored in Chapter 4). Counselors should focus on using motivational strategies, tailoring interventions to the adolescent's interests, involving family members, creating a safe and non-judgmental space, and incorporating peer support. Tailoring interventions might involve integrating activities that the adolescent enjoys, such as sports, music, or art, into the therapeutic process. Engaging adolescents in meaningful and enjoyable activities can make treatment more appealing and relevant to their lives. In addition, using technology, such as multimedia tools, social media, and digital platforms, can enhance engagement. Adolescents today are "digital natives," and incorporating technology into counseling can make sessions more relevant and engaging.155

3. **Integrated Care.** To provide integrated services for adolescents, counselors must adopt a holistic approach. Effective integrated care requires collaboration among different service providers, including mental health professionals, medical practitioners, educators, and social workers. Collaborative care increases the opportunities for earlier detection of mental health and substance use problems, and physical health conditions. Effective case management is crucial for service linkages. For instance, a case manager can facilitate an adolescent's return to a community educational setting by coordinating with the treatment team and education officials. This collaboration ensures that educational goals are met while continuing to address the adolescent's clinical monitoring and recovery needs. Earlier in this chapter, models of integrated care were presented.122 IC&RC Alcohol and Drug Counselor (ADC) Certification Examination Study Guide

**4. Family Involvement.** Family involvement is a cornerstone of treatment for adolescents. Family therapy and family psychoeducation can help address underlying issues, improve communication, and strengthen the support system around the adolescent. Engaging family members in the treatment process can provide additional support and reinforce the adolescent's commitment to recovery.

**5. Trauma-Informed Care.** Trauma-informed care involves creating a safe and supportive environment that empowers adolescents and fosters their resilience. Counselors should focus on building a strong therapeutic alliance through consistent, empathetic, and non-judgmental interactions. Counselors should also be knowledgeable about the signs and effects of trauma and how it can influence substance use and behavior. This understanding allows them to tailor their interventions to address the specific needs of traumatized adolescents. Utilizing trauma-informed therapeutic techniques, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) that integrates trauma-specific interventions, can be particularly effective. See Chapter 6 for specific trauma-related interventions.

**6. Use Evidence-based Practices.** Using evidence-based practices (EBPs) in the treatment of adolescents
with SUDs/MHDs helps to ensure standards of care are effective, safe, and standardized. EBPs are
developed through rigorous research, providing clinicians with reliable, validated methods that enhance
their confidence and competence. They promote consistency, efficiency, and accountability in treatment,
ensuring resources are utilized effectively and minimizing the risk of adverse effects. EBPs not only
address immediate treatment needs but also support long-term recovery and relapse prevention.

Many EBPs have been found to be effective for adolescents and their families. Chapter 6 in this study
guide presents information in detail in this regard. For now, one example of an EBP for adolescents
is **Community Reinforcement and Family Training (CRAFT).** CRAFT is a parent-focused intervention
designed to help parents facilitate their adolescent's entry into treatment and support subsequent
behavior change. It has been successful in engaging resistant adolescents by improving parent and
family functioning and encouraging adolescents to participate in treatment. ¹⁵⁶

**7. Cultural Competence.** Cultural and gender competence ensures that adolescents and their families
receive effective, respectful care aligned with their cultural beliefs, practices, gender-specific needs, and
preferred language. This approach also respects racial and ethnic identity, sexual orientation, religion,
age, geographic location, and other affiliations. Providers must recognize the relevance of these factors
in the development of substance SUDs/MHDs and the effectiveness of treatments. This is an overarching
principle for all services.

Effective counseling involves adapting evidence-based practices to fit the cultural context of the
adolescent. This could include using culturally relevant metaphors, examples, and culturally specific
interventions. To demonstrate cultural competence that is particularly relevant to adolescents, it is
also important that counselors show tolerance and understanding of younger generations' preferences
in language, fashion, music, and other cultural expressions. Here are several strategies counselors can
employ:

   >   **Embrace Popular Culture:** Stay updated on trends in music, fashion, and language to better build
       rapport and trust with adolescents, making them feel understood and valued.

   >   **Innovative Therapies:** Incorporate a variety of strategies that make treatment more interesting and
       relevant. For example, use music, dance/movement, and art therapies, like using rap and hip-hop, to
       help them express themselves and address issues in a culturally engaging way.

   >   **Incorporate Language Preferences:** Understand and respect adolescent slang and colloquial language
       to communicate more effectively, making them feel comfortable and understood. This doesn’t
       mean the counselor should use slang; rather, the counselor needs to understand the meaning of the
       language used by youth.

   >   **Fashion Sensitivity:** Avoid judging clothing choices and use fashion preferences to understand
       adolescents’ identities and social influences, fostering a positive therapeutic relationship.

   >   **Interactive and Engaging Techniques:** Use multimedia tools, social media, and digital platforms to
       enhance engagement.[Layout: A single column of text with a header. A sidebar is on the left. A spiral binding is visible on the right edge of the page.]

**Older Adults**

Nearly 58.6 million Americans are 65 and older, with projections estimating that the population of older adults will grow to 94.7 million in 2060.¹⁵⁷ On average, a 65-year-old (man or woman) can expect to live another 17 years.¹⁵⁸ Older adults remain physically active for longer than ever before. For most older adults, good health ensures independence, security, and productivity as they age. Unfortunately, millions struggle every day with challenges such as chronic diseases, falls, physical inactivity, oral health concerns, and behavioral health issues—all of which can severely impact quality of life.¹⁵⁹

[Text box on the left with the heading "AGE VARIATIONS"]
**AGE VARIATIONS**

It is important to note that the term “older adults” has variation. Older adults (age 65 and older) are further divided into subgroups – “young old” (65-74 years), “middle old” (75-84 years) and “oldest old” (85+ years).

These groupings help to understand the variability in individual experiences. When considering age, it is important to consider an individual’s functional age as well as their chronological age.
[End of text box]

The number of older adults with SUDs is increasing. The U.S. population of older adults increasingly consists of baby boomers. Baby boomers came of age at a time when substance use tended to be more culturally acceptable, making them more open to and less judgmental about substance use than prior generations. (Not all subgroups of baby boomers experienced this openness and freedom from judgment about substance use, such as racially and ethnically diverse populations.) Because of baby boomers’ exposure to drugs and alcohol at a younger age, their generation has higher rates of past or current SUDs compared with previous generations.¹⁶⁰

Both SUDs and MHDs among older adults present a complex challenge. Older adults often have unique physiological, psychological, and social conditions and face an increasing prevalence of SUDs. Aging can lead to social, psychological, and physical changes that may increase vulnerability to problematic substance use. Despite their growing numbers, SUDs in older adults remain underestimated, underdiagnosed, and often untreated, which can prevent effective management and worsen health disparities.

Substance use in older adults is dangerous and potentially deadly. The vulnerability of older adults, 80% of whom have at least one chronic illness, and 77% of whom have two, results in complex conditions when substance use is added to the mix.¹⁶¹ There are many areas of vulnerability which makes identifying and treating SUDs in older adults especially critical.¹⁶²

**Physiological Vulnerabilities**

1.  **Increased Sensitivity to Substances**: Due to physiological changes associated with aging, older adults have reduced organ function, including hepatic and renal impairments, which can alter the metabolism and elimination of drugs. This increased sensitivity often results in more pronounced and prolonged effects of substances, raising the risk for overdose and adverse drug interactions.

2.  **Polypharmacy**: Many older adults are prescribed multiple medications to manage various chronic conditions. The combination of prescribed medications with alcohol or other substances of abuse can lead to dangerous interactions and increase the risk of unintentional misuse or overdose.

3.  **Mobility Issues**: Many older adults have difficulty walking or not having access to mobility assistance devices (like a walker or wheelchair). They may also be unable to travel to appointments (e.g., not having a car, not having access to public transportation).

**Psychological and Cognitive Vulnerabilities**

1.  **Neurocognitive Disorders**: Substance use can worsen existing cognitive impairments such as dementia or precipitate new cognitive deficits. This complicates the diagnosis and management of SUDs as the symptoms of substance use can often mimic or mask the signs of cognitive decline.[Layout: Single column with a header and a footer. The header contains "CHAPTER 3: Co-Occurring Conditions and Special Populations" on the left and "125" on the right. The left edge of the page shows the rings of a spiral binding.]

CHAPTER 3: Co-Occurring Conditions and Special Populations 125

**2. Mental Health Issues:** Depression, anxiety, and other MHDs are common among older adults and can
co-occur with SUDs. These conditions may serve as both a cause and a consequence of substance use,
creating a cycle that is difficult to break without integrated treatment approaches.

**3. Lack of Awareness:** Older adults may not realize how much they are drinking or that their substance
use is a problem. For example, a woman in her 70s might think she can safely drink the same amount
of alcohol that she drank in her 30s. This is not necessarily so. Some older adults think the amount of
alcohol they drink is not risky although it exceeds recommendations for low-risk drinking. Sometimes
a client’s lack of awareness can result from cognitive impairment, making it hard for the client to self-
monitor alcohol intake.

**Social Vulnerabilities**

**1. Isolation and Loneliness:** Social isolation and feelings of loneliness are significant issues among older
adults, which can increase the risk of substance use as individuals may turn to alcohol or drugs as a form
of self-soothing. The lack of social support from family members also makes recovery more challenging.
Older adults who are socially connected and feel positive about their social network appear to have better
health and well-being than older people who are not socially well connected.

**2. Bereavement and Life Transitions:** The loss of loved ones and significant life changes such as retirement
or moving to assisted living can trigger or worsen SUDs. These events can lead to increased feelings of
purposelessness or grief, contributing to problematic substance use.

**3. Cultural Norms:** Cultural norms can influence a person’s help-seeking behavior. For example, an older
person whose culture discourages talking about mental health issues or problematic substance use may
not seek help. In some cultures, it is more acceptable to talk about physical symptoms than it is to talk
about symptoms of addiction or feeling depressed or wanting to hurt oneself. This can make it hard for a
healthcare provider to know when a client from this kind of cultural background has a problem related to
an SUD or MHD.

**BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS**

As noted earlier, problematic substance use, including SUDs, among older adults often goes unrecognized and
untreated. Societal norms, values, and biases play a role in this phenomenon. Some people hold the ageist false
belief that SUDs do not exist or need no treatment in this age group. Others—even some healthcare providers—
mistake SUD symptoms for normal age-related changes. Some healthcare providers may focus more on older
adults’ reports of physical/medical complaints. Similarly, some older adults may deny or hide their substance
use-related problems from their healthcare providers. Unfortunately, many would rather avoid the shame,
prejudice, and discrimination associated with problematic substance use and mental health diagnoses. Lack of
treatment for problematic substance use and SUDs can result in more risk of fractures secondary to recurrent
falls, memory loss, sleep disturbances, anxiety, and depression.¹⁶³

In general, the use of alcohol, tobacco, and illicit and non-medical prescription drugs decreases with age¹⁶⁴;
however, recent survey findings raise concern especially for alcohol and prescription opioids, which are the two
most problematically used substances among older adults. While the percentage of older adults who misused
opioids in the last year (1.8%) seems low, it is important to realize this means 1,054,800 individuals. Results
from the 2022 *National Survey on Drug Use and Health* (NSDUH) survey pertaining to individuals 50 and older, and a
narrower breakout of 65 or older, are shown the following data.¹⁶⁵126 IC&RC Alcohol and Drug Counselor (ADC) Certification Examination Study Guide

[Table: 3 columns. Column headers are: "Reported Alcohol and Drug Use", "50 and older", "65 and older".]

| Any MHD                                              | 3.0%         | 1.4%         |
| Co-occurring SUD and any MHD in past year            | 3.9%         | (not given)  |

**Meeting the Needs of Older Adults** ¹⁶⁷,¹⁶⁸

Twenty percent of the US population is expected to be 65 years or older by 2030.

With the increasing prevalence of MHDs and SUDs in older adults, it is estimated that 10.1 to 14.4 million older adults will have one or more of these disorders by 2030.

Many risks are associated with the combination of prescription medications and substance use among older adults. Improper use of prescribed medication is common, whether because of cognitive decline or attempting to save money by using their medications sparingly or taking another person’s remaining medications. Mixing these medications with alcohol or illicit drugs can exacerbate health issues or interfere with the effectiveness of prescribed treatments. For example, many prescription medications have interactions with alcohol and illicit drugs. Mixing substances can lead to unpredictable effects, including increased sedation, impaired coordination, and heightened risk of falls or accidents. Certain combinations can also lead to dangerous interactions, such as respiratory depression or liver damage. Lastly, issues such as age-related changes in drug metabolism, potential interactions with over-the-counter medications, dietary supplements, and alcohol as well as cognitive decline make these risky interactions of special concern. Healthcare providers need to carefully assess each individual’s medical history, current medications, and lifestyle factors¹⁶⁶

Older adults with problematic substance use or SUDs often experience a range of co-occurring MHDs. According to the 2022 *National Survey on Drug Use and Health*, approximately one in five adults over 50 years old experienced MHD, SUD or both in the previous year. Depression and anxiety are the most prevalent MHDs in older adults. The Kaiser Family Foundation reported that one in four (24%) of adults ages 65 and older acknowledged anxiety or depression; the rates were highest among those who are female, Hispanic, low income, in relatively poor health, who live alone, or who have experienced recent loss of employment income in their household.¹⁶⁹ Both of these conditions bring significant distress and suffering which can lead to impairments in physical, mental, and social functioning.CHAPTER 3: Co-Occurring Conditions and Special Populations 127

**IMPLICATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND OTHER SERVICES**

Older adults can benefit just as much as younger adults using prevailing evidence-based treatments. The
practices that work particularly well for older adults include outreach and engagement, intensive case
management, short-term structured counseling along with medications, access to services in regular healthcare
settings, and having behavioral health experts in long-term care facilities. Motivational Interviewing and other
supportive methods that consider older adults’ unique mental, social, and health needs, along with their cultural
values, are important for inclusion in treatment plans.¹⁷⁰

SAMHSA outlines the following principles of care for older adults with problematic substance use, SUDs and/or
co-occurring MHDs. These principles are essential for understanding and improving the care and treatment for
this population:¹⁷¹﹐ ¹⁷²

1. **Understand the Developmental Issues of Aging:** Recognizing the unique physical, psychological, and
social changes that accompany aging is crucial. Healthcare providers must consider how aging impacts
drug metabolism, the risk of interactions between medications, and the greater physical vulnerability to
the effects of substances.
2. **Acknowledge and Address the Diversity Among Older Adults:** This principle emphasizes the need for
personalized care that considers the diverse backgrounds of older adults, including cultural, gender,
racial, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic differences, which can influence the experience and
treatment of SUDs.
3. **Recognize the Difference Between Early- and Late-Onset SUDs Among Older Adults:** It’s important to
distinguish between those who have had a long history of substance issues (early-onset) and those who
develop issues later in life (late-onset), as the causes and appropriate interventions may differ.
4. **Emphasize Client Education, Early Identification, Screening, and Brief Treatment:** Educating older adults
about the risks and signs of SUDs and MHDs is vital. Early identification and screening can lead to timely
and brief interventions, which are often more effective and less disruptive. A comprehensive approach to
screening is essential for depression, anxiety, substance use, chronic pain, risk of and elder abuse.
5. **Engage in Health Risk Reduction Practices:** This includes strategies to minimize the adverse effects of
substance use and promote safer practices, recognizing that absolute abstinence may not be a realistic
goal for all older adults. Three key elements of preventive care for older adults in recovery are nutrition,
exercise, and fall prevention.
6. **Provide Person-Centered Care:** Treatment plans should be tailored to the individual’s specific health
needs, preferences, and goals. This also includes accommodation that needs to be made for the impact
of dementia, language, and hearing barriers. It is important to clearly explain medication and treatment
options, repeat when necessary and provide in writing using friendly, helpful, accessible language.
Tapping into the person’s strengths help to promote self-management and communicate positive views
of aging.
7. **Build Alliances with Older Clients; Use Age-Sensitive Strategies to Engage/Retain Them in Treatment:**
Creating therapeutic alliances through respect, empathy, and collaboration encourages engagement and
retention in treatment programs, which can be particularly challenging with older populations.
8. **Help Older Clients Use Social Networks and Community-Based Services:** Leveraging existing social and
recovery networks and community resources can provide crucial support and reduce isolation, which is
common in older adults with SUDs. Also identify and use aging system resources like peer support and
advanced care planning supports.
9. **Encourage Family and Caregiver Involvement:** Involving family and other caregivers in the treatment
process can improve outcomes by providing additional support and ensuring that care continues outside
of clinical settings. Their involvement can lead to enhanced support, improved communication, increased
treatment adherence, and better management of recurrent substance use and/or mental health symptoms.[Layout: Single column of text with a header and a page number at the top left. The right edge of the page shows the binding of a spiral-bound book.]

**10. Coordinate Care and Develop Service Linkages:** Effective treatment often requires coordinating various types of care (medical, psychiatric, social services) and creating linkages between different service providers to address all aspects of a client's health. It is helpful to understand and explain Medicare benefits, including Part D and preventive benefits (e.g., alcohol screening, depression screening) to patients and their caregivers. Coordinate benefits for dually eligible Medicaid/Medicare beneficiaries, including certain social services that are available with lower cost sharing.

**LGBTQI+**

The percentage of U.S. adults who self-identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or something other than heterosexual has increased to a new high of 7.2%, which is double the percentage from 2012, when Gallup first measured it.173 The past decade has brought remarkable changes in the social, political, and legal status of these individuals. Despite increased visibility and social acceptance of sexual and gender diverse populations, discriminatory policies and practices remain. Many people who are members of these populations—particularly those who are also members of other marginalized populations, such as racial and ethnic minorities—continue to experience stigma, discrimination, and violence where they live, work, play, and pray.174

As the abbreviation LGBTQI+ suggests, this population is not homogenous. It includes individuals with many distinct sexual orientations, gender identities, gender expressions, and variations in sex characteristics. These are complex and interrelated constructs that are conceptually distinct. Each letter stands for a specific group, though the acronym continues to evolve as understanding and recognition of different identities grow. Here’s a breakdown of the common components of the acronym:175

» **L** stands for **Lesbian**: Women who are emotionally, romantically, or sexually attracted to other women.

» **G** stands for **Gay**: Typically refers to men who are attracted to other men, but can also be used as an umbrella term for people who are attracted to the same sex.

» **B** stands for **Bisexual**: Individuals who are attracted to both their own gender and other genders.

» **T** stands for **Transgender**: People whose gender identity differs from the sex they were assigned at birth. This group includes a wide range of gender experiences, including nonbinary, genderqueer, and genderfluid individuals.

» **Q** stands for **Queer/Questioning**: Queer is a term used by some who reject traditional gender identities and seek a broader, more fluid understanding of sexual orientation. Questioning refers to individuals who are exploring their sexual orientation, gender identity, or both.

» **I** stands for **Intersex**: Individuals born with physical sex characteristics that do not fit typical binary notions of male or female bodies.

» **+** represents other identities and expressions that fall under the broader spectrum of sexuality and gender diversity, including pansexual (attracted to people regardless of gender), asexual (lack of sexual attraction to others), and aromantic (lack of romantic attraction to others), among others.

The first three terms—lesbian, gay, and bisexual—refer to **sexual orientation**, which relates to the gender(s) of the people to whom someone feels physically or romantically attracted. Self-identification is how people describe their own sexual orientation. The term **transgender** refers to **gender identity**, which is distinct from sexual orientation. Transgender is a broad term that describes people who identify as a sex or gender different from the sex they were assigned at birth. For example, a transgender woman is a woman who was assigned male at birth, and a transgender man is a man who was assigned female at birth.176 Sexual and gender minorities are also diverse with respect to other identities, including age, race, ethnicity, language, national origin, religion, spirituality, ability, and socioeconomic status.[Layout: A single column of text on the left, with a header at the top. A large black and white photograph occupies the right side of the page, alongside the text.]

CHAPTER 3: Co-Occurring Conditions and Special Populations 129

The variability within the LGBTQI+ community
is significant because it includes a wide range of
identities and experiences. Other terms are also used
frequently today, such as non-binary, agender, bigender,
genderqueer, gender fluid, and gender-nonconforming,
refer to people who identify outside the categories of
male or female. People who embrace these identities
may or may not identify as transgender. Some people
also use the terms Two Spirit and queer to describe
gender identity as well as sexual orientation. People
who are not transgender are cisgender (individuals
whose gender identity is congruent with their sex
assigned at birth). Like cisgender people, transgender
people can be of any sexual orientation.¹⁷⁷

**LGBTQI+ AND SUBSTANCE USE AND MENTAL**
**HEALTH CONDITIONS**

Data from the 2022 *National Survey on Drug Abuse and*
*Health*¹⁷⁸ indicates that lesbian, gay, and bisexual (in
particular) adults are more likely than non-LGBTQI+
adults to use substances, have SUDs, and experience
mental health issues, including serious thoughts of
suicide.¹⁷⁹ Fifty-three percent (53%) of LBG adults aged
18 years of older reported illicit drug use in the past
year – as compared to 24.9% of non-LGB adults in the
past year.¹⁸⁰

Consider this additional data that highlights how
sexual minorities experience unique stressors that can
contribute to adverse substance use and mental health
outcomes.

» Experiencing psychological or physical abuse as a result of one’s nonconforming gender expression or
identity is associated with a three- to four-fold higher odds of alcohol, marijuana, or cocaine use, as well
as 8-times higher odds of any drug use, among transgender women.¹⁸¹

» LGBTQ young people are **more than four times as likely** to attempt suicide than their peers, and **41% of LGBTQ+ young people** seriously considered attempting suicide in the past year, including **roughly half of transgender and nonbinary youth**.¹⁸², ¹⁸³

» People who identify as bisexual may experience additional problems with substance use and mental
health due to sexual orientation-based discrimination, bisexual invisibility and erasure, and a lack of
bisexual-affirmative support.¹⁸⁴

» Bias-motivated violence, such as hate crimes based on sexual orientation or gender identity, may have
particularly severe psychological consequences for LGBTQI+ people.¹⁸⁵

Several theories exist regarding the observed differences in substance use and mental health prevalence between
LGBTQI+ and non-LGBTQI+ populations. One is that the increased rates of behavioral health difficulties are
not caused by their identities, but are related to increased stress from discrimination, bullying, violence and
rejection faced more frequently by LGBTQI+ individuals.¹⁸⁶ The Minority Stress Model proposed by Ilan Meyer
is the most widely adopted framework.¹⁸⁷ Meyer asserts that stigma, prejudice, and discrimination create a
hostile and stressful social environment, contributing to internal stressors like low self-esteem, shame, guilt,

[Image: A black and white, slightly grainy photograph of a person from the chest up, looking upwards and to their left. The person has curly hair and is wearing a plaid shirt under a darker jacket. The background is dark and indistinct. The image is placed to the right of the main text block.]130 IC&RC Alcohol and Drug Counselor (ADC) Certification Examination Study Guide

and internalized stigma. Stigma can take many forms, such as discrimination, harassment, family rejection, social rejection, or violence. Minority stress exposures contribute to disturbances in physical health such as metabolism, immune function, cardiovascular health, cognition, and mood. Minority stress is also associated with higher prevalence of unhealthy behaviors, such as tobacco use and binge drinking, and it is a risk factor for causes of mortality that include HIV and suicide.188

Another factor leading to adverse physical and behavioral health consequences is the use of drugs for sexual enhancement among men who have sex with men (MSM)—often called **chemsex**. Drugs most often used in this context are crystal methamphetamine (in particular), mephedrone, GHB/GBL, cocaine, and ketamine.190 While most MSM who engage in chemsex administer drugs non-intravenously, some administer drugs intravenously; this practice is known as **slamsex** or slamming.191 These sexual enhancement practices are linked to high-risk behaviors and increased prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV, especially among HIV-negative MSM.

Among youth, SAMHSA’s 2023 report—*Moving Beyond Change Efforts: Evidence and Action to Support and Affirm LGBTQI+ Youth*192 – provides a comprehensive research overview of treatment and other service best practices and important information on behavioral health concerns within this community of youth. Importantly, it highlights research that stresses how attempts to change an individual’s sexual orientation and gender identity (“conversion therapy”) are harmful and should not be provided. The report documents how LGBTQI+ youth also experience significant physical and behavioral health inequities. Several factors contribute to these inequities and result in minority stress, which is harmful to behavioral health, including: 193, 194, 195

» Stigma
» Negative social attitudes
» Systemic barriers in healthcare
» Rejection and lack of support from families, caregivers, and communities
» Bullying and harassment, and lack of recognition and support in schools

In addition, some youth with diverse sexual orientation and/or gender identity, like adults, are at increased risk for:

» Psychological distress (e.g., depressive symptoms, anxiety, trauma, and behavioral disorders)196
» Substance use
» Suicidal ideation and attempts197, 198
» Victimization, violence, and homelessness
» Involvement with child welfare services, often stemming from family rejection199
» Involvement in juvenile justice programs200

**SERVICE IMPLICATIONS**

When addressing substance use and mental health issues in LGBTQI+ individuals, it’s important to consider a mix of factors including their demographics, gender-related issues, and social challenges. The behavioral health field, in partnership with expert practitioners working with this population, has been systematically updating the standards of care to reflect these complex issues. Research has shown that practice standards need to be stratified according to the gender identity concerns and related experiences across children, adolescents, and adults.201[LLM OCR returned no text for this page][Layout: Single column page with a header at the top and a spiral binding graphic on the right edge.

5. **Tailoring Assessment and Treatment Approaches:**
Standard SUD assessment and treatment models may
need to be adapted to fully address the specific needs
of LGBTQI+ individuals. For example, when gathering
substance use and treatment history, counselors also
need to: gather information about experiences with
discrimination and oppression and LGBTQ+ developmental
milestones (e.g., coming out, first sexual experiences,
transitioning, etc.); and explore possible relationships
between the substance use and these intersecting risk
factors. The use of evidence-based treatment approaches
for this population needs to be examined/used – such as
AFFIRM206 and LGB-Affirmative Cognitive Behavioral
Therapy (CBT).²⁰⁷

6. **Creating an Inclusive Environment:** Ensure that the treatment environment is inclusive and affirms all
gender and sexual identities. This involves using inclusive language, respecting pronouns, understanding
the nuances of gender dysphoria and its impact on substance use, and addressing any LGBTQI+-specific
triggers for substance use.

7. **Training, Education and Supervision:** SUD counselors may require additional training and education to
understand the nuances of LGBTQI+ identities and experiences fully. This training should include an
understanding of the history, culture, and health disparities affecting the LGBTQI+ community, as well
as skills in providing affirming and effective treatment. In addition, counselors should seek guidance
from supervisors who have expertise and experience in LGBTQ+ issues (as possible). This can provide a
safe space to explore and understand the unique needs of LGBTQ+ clients and ensure that the counseling
provided is appropriate. Counselors can also engage in consultation with peers and experts in LGBTQ+
issues to discuss complex cases, share resources, and gain new perspectives.

8. **Collaboration with LGBTQI+ Organizations:** Counselors can benefit from collaborating with organizations
and groups that specialize in LGBTQI+ health and wellness. These partnerships can provide additional
resources, support, and training to enhance the counselor’s ability to serve this population effectively.

**Criminal Justice-Involved²⁰⁸, ²⁰⁹**

People with SUDs and MHDs are over-represented in the justice system. It is estimated that 18% of the general
population has a MHD;²¹⁰ however, an estimated 44% of those in jail and 37% of those in prison have an MHD.²¹¹
Likewise, it is estimated that, of the general U.S. population, 11.4% of 18–25 year olds, and 6.2% of those over 25
years old have an SUD;²¹² however, it is estimated that 63% of people in jail and 58% in prison have an SUD.²¹³
Nearly four (4) in 10 state prisoners (39%) and three (3) in 10 federal prisoners (31%) reported using drugs at the
time of the offense.²¹⁴ Additionally, 60% of youth in juvenile justice facilities met criteria for an SUD.²¹⁵ Most
individuals, in the community and within correctional facilities, do not receive the treatment that they need.

Researchers have found that even brief incarceration leads to adverse consequences, including loss of
employment and future employment opportunities, poorer physical and mental health, loss of housing and
future housing opportunities, and disruptions in family life and social connections.²¹⁶ Incarceration has a
disproportionate health impact on women, sexual and gender minorities, and people of color.²¹⁷ When compared
to individuals without a history of incarceration, incarcerated and formerly incarcerated individuals these groups
have a higher prevalence of chronic medical conditions, premature mortality,²¹⁸ and reduced access to healthcare
services.²¹⁹ Once in the criminal justice system, individuals with SUDs and MHDs stay in jails longer, have an
increased risk for self-harm, and receive more frequent punitive responses to infractions.²²⁰

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a significant concern among individuals involved in the criminal justice
system. Many are frequently exposed to violence and traumatic experiences, particularly women.²²¹ Some[Layout: Single column of text at the top, with a large image filling the bottom half of the page. A header is present at the top right, and a spiral binding is visible on the left edge of the page.]

CHAPTER 3: Co-Occurring Conditions and Special Populations 133

researchers suggest that the trauma people experience behind bars can lead to Post-Incarceration Syndrome (PICS)
a syndrome that shares characteristics with PTSD, in addition to a specific cluster of mental health symptoms,
including institutionalized personality traits (like distrusting others, difficulty maintaining relationships, and
problems making decisions), social-sensory disorientation (issues with spatial reasoning and difficulty with
social interactions), and social and temporal alienation (the feeling of not belonging in social settings).222 Due
to funding and staffing limitations, many people with MHDs do not receive the services they need and their
conditions often worsen inside jail and prison settings.

Most incarcerated individuals return to their communities, families, and social networks and subsequently
require community-based behavioral and physical healthcare services. They often encounter significant barriers
to behavioral health treatment, stable and safe housing, meaningful employment, and other recovery support
services. Community-based behavioral health providers play a key role in ensuring that every individual they
serve has the treatment, support, skills, and opportunity for recovery and lives productively with dignity and
respect.

**CRIMINOGENIC RISK**²²³

**Criminogenic risk** is the likelihood that an individual will engage in future illegal behavior in the form of a new crime or failure to comply with probation or parole conditions. Criminogenic factors are risks and needs that research has demonstrated increase the likelihood of re-offense. There are eight such risk factors, termed criminogenic risks:²²⁴

1.  antisocial personality
2.  antisocial behavior
3.  antisocial cognition (thinking and beliefs)
4.  antisocial associates
5.  problematic substance use
6.  problematic marital and family circumstances
7.  problematic circumstances at work or school
8.  problematic circumstances with leisure and recreation

Of these risk factors, the first four are often prioritized in interventions targeting recidivism, because they have been found to have the strongest relationship with criminal offending.²²⁵

Individuals who are involved with the criminal justice system have a diverse range of behavioral health, criminogenic, case management, and social support needs. Some individuals may have higher behavioral health needs and low or no criminogenic risks, while some may have higher needs related to their criminogenic risk and low behavioral health needs. No two individuals are the same, and while many individuals with SUDs and MHDs may be incarcerated for low-level, nonviolent crimes, some individuals may have moderate or high criminogenic risk. All individuals should have access to behavioral health treatment, regardless of their criminogenic risks and needs.

**IMPLICATIONS FOR TREATMENT**

Knowledge about criminal justice procedures, criminal justice professionals, and terminology, and the kinds of experiences people with SUDs and MHDs have with the criminal justice system is essential for serving justice-involved individuals. This knowledge can help counselors tailor treatment services and supports, as well as assist clients in meeting supervision requirements and avoiding further involvement with the criminal justice system. Understanding the roles and functions of criminal justice professionals can help case managers and counselors navigate the criminal justice system with their clients.

Addressing criminogenic risk and need factors is important. This includes programming to address criminal thinking and behaviors, comprehensive case management, prosocial engagement and activities, and vocational and educational supports. Clinical assessment is the first step in treatment and is used to establish the behavioral health needs and services to be addressed in an individual’s treatment plan. Standardized and validated criminogenic risk and needs assessments can be used to direct resources and supports that reduce an individual’s likelihood of recidivism or risk of re-offense.

**Active Military and Veterans**

The stresses of deployments and the unique culture of the military offer both risks and protective factors related
to substance use among active-duty personnel. Deployment is associated with smoking initiation, unhealthy
drinking, drug use, risky behaviors and MHDs.²²⁸ Service members can face dishonorable discharge and even
criminal prosecution for a positive drug test, which can discourage illicit drug use. Once active-duty personnel
leave the military some protective influences are gone, and substance use and other mental health issues among
veterans become of greater concern.²²⁹

In 2021, 16% of active-duty service members were diagnosed with at least one SUD or MHD. These disorders
include adjustment disorders, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), SUDs,
personality disorders, and psychoses. Female service members had a higher diagnosis rate of 16% compared to
8.3% for male members. The highest prevalence of these disorders was found among service members under
25 years of age, across both sexes. Among all diagnoses, adjustment disorder was the most common, followed
by anxiety and depressive disorders. Notably, the rates of being diagnosed with adjustment disorder, anxiety
disorder (excluding PTSD), or mood disorder were twice as high in females compared to males (e.g., adjustment
disorder was 16% for females and 7.5% for males). SUDs were diagnosed in 3.3% of service members, but it was
the only condition where the prevalence was higher in males (3.4%) than in females (2.6%).²³⁰

**VETERANS**

America’s veterans have served around the world, on every continent, including Antarctica. Although recent
wars in Iraq and Afghanistan often come to mind, most of America’s veterans served before the Global War
on Terror. In fact, of the country’s 16.5 million living veterans, 8.1 million (or nearly 50%) are aged 65 years or
older. Of the total number of living U.S. veterans, 7.8 million veterans, or 43%, served in the Gulf War era and
5.6 million (30%) served during the Vietnam War era from 1950 to 1973.²³¹ This data shows it is important to look
at veterans, not just in terms of their recent service, but in a generational context. Other data shows that men
vastly outnumber women among veterans, notably those who are older than 70 years. During the 1970s, Congress
passed legislation that allowed women to enroll in service academies, which greatly expanded the opportunities
for women to serve in the U.S. armed forces. Since that time, the number of female veterans has increased, and,
in 2022, made up 1 in 10 veterans.²³²

All veterans experience a period of readjustment as they reintegrate into life with family, friends, and
community. Those who have been deployed to combat zones also need to process exposure to combat which may
contribute to problems for veterans, as well as their spouses and family members. Behaviors needed to survive
in a combat zone, such as maintaining a constant state of alertness, may initially translate into troublesome
behaviors in civilian life, such as feeling edgy or jumpy and being easily startled. They may experience a
variety of common stress reactions, including sleeplessness, nightmares, and feelings of sadness, rejection,
abandonment, or hopelessness. Veterans may also struggle to concentrate; engage in aggressive behavior, such
as aggressive driving; and use alcohol, tobacco, and drugs excessively. The intensity and duration of these and
other worrisome behaviors can indicate a more serious problem and the need for professional treatment.²³³

The newest generation of veterans is characterized by an increased number of Reservists and National Guard
members who served in combat zones; a higher proportion of women; and different patterns of injuries, such
as multiple injuries from explosions, than were seen among veterans of previous wars. Many service members
returning from duty in Afghanistan or Iraq experience symptoms of psychological distress, such as PTSD
(23%). It is estimated that between 37%–50% of veterans from these wars have been diagnosed with at least
one MHD. These conditions are strongly associated with SUDs, as are other problems including reintegration
stresses, sleep disturbances, traumatic brain injury (TBI), and violence in relationships. Onset of SUDs can also
emerge secondary to other MHDs associated with these stressors. Between 37%–50% of veterans returning from
Afghanistan and Iraq were diagnosed with a co-occurring SUDs/MHDs, and 63% of those diagnosed with SUDs
also met criteria for PTSD.²³⁴, ²³⁵CHAPTER 3: Co-Occurring Conditions and Special Populations

An x-axis below the bar chart is labeled "0 1M 2M 3M". The caption below the x-axis reads: "Number of Adults with Specific Past Year SUD among Veterans Aged 18 or Older".]

SUDs are a significant problem among U.S. military veterans, with alcohol use disorder and binge drinking (40.2% of alcohol users) as the most significant areas.²³⁶ The 2022 NSDUH also found that veterans continue to engage in various forms of illicit drug use, including marijuana, which remains the most used illicit substance. There was a notable issue with the misuse of prescription drugs (opioids and sedatives) among veterans.

Data also suggests that approximately half of veterans may not connect with available resources, benefits, and services. Without support, more complex behavioral health concerns usually emerge. In 2020, approximately 5.2 million veterans experienced a behavioral health condition; however, more than half of veterans with a MHD did not receive treatment within the past year and more than 90% of those experiencing an SUD did not receive treatment.²³⁷

**SUICIDE**

Suicide among U.S. active-duty service members and veterans remains a critical concern. For active-duty service members, the Department of Defense reports a slight increase in suicide rates in 2022 compared to 2021, although both years saw lower rates than 2020. Efforts to reduce these rates have been ongoing, including the implementation of comprehensive suicide prevention strategies that involve over 100 actions directed by the Secretary of Defense.²³⁸

The Veterans Administrations’ 2023 *National Suicide Prevention Report* reveals the following data related to suicide among veterans:

» In 2021, suicide was the 13th-leading cause of death for veterans overall, and the second-leading cause of death among veterans under age 45-years-old.
» In 2021, there were 6,042 suicide deaths among veteran men and 350 suicide deaths among veteran women.
» The unadjusted rate of suicide in 2021 among U.S. veterans was **33.9 per 100,000** individuals, up from 32.6 per 100,000 in 2020.138 IC&RC Alcohol and Drug Counselor (ADC) Certification Examination Study Guide

The report also addresses the risk factors that they believe to have contributed to the suicide rate among
veterans:

“Veteran distress increased from fall 2019 to fall and winter 2020, with evidence of the highest
increases in distress among veterans aged 18- to- 44-years-old and among women veterans.
These increases in reported distress were associated with increasing socioeconomic concerns,
greater problematic alcohol use and decreased community integration. A systematic review of 23
studies found increases in the prevalence rates of alcohol use, anxiety, depression, posttraumatic
stress disorder, stress, loneliness, and suicidal ideation. The results of this systematic review found
key risk factors to include pandemic-related stress, family relationship strain, lack of social support,
financial concerns and preexisting mental health disorders.”

**HOMELESSNESS**

Veterans have been overrepresented in the homeless population since at least the late 1980s. The rate of
homelessness among this population has shifted significantly in the past decade. In 2023, 35,574 veterans
were experiencing homelessness—22 of every 10,000 veterans in the U.S. The number of veterans experiencing
homelessness increased by 7% (2,445 more veterans) between 2022 and 2023; however, despite increases in
experiences of veteran homelessness between those years, **the number of veterans experiencing homelessness**
**is 52% lower than it was in 2009,** the baseline year for reporting veterans experiencing homelessness in the
annual report to Congress.²³⁹

The presence of veterans within the general U.S. homeless population is regarded as a point of public shame
by many; however, public concern for their health and well-being has been strong. The reduction in veteran
homelessness is largely the result of actions at the federal level between 2010 and 2019, when a collaborative
effort to end veteran homelessness was very active. Two key strategies contributed to this success: (1) the
adoption of the **Housing First** approach and (2) substantial investments in veteran-specific programs. The
Housing First strategy significantly reduced the waiting times for housing placement from 223 days to 35,
improved the stability of housing for veterans, and decreased visits to the emergency room.²⁴⁰ Additionally,
the Supportive Services for Veterans Families (SSVF) program, started in 2011, provided rapid re-housing
and prevention services, successfully stabilizing over 70% of its participants in permanent housing. These
programs, supported consistently by Congressional funding, have been crucial in significantly reducing veteran
homelessness.[Layout: Single column with a header and page number.]

CHAPTER 3: Co-Occuring Conditions and Special Populations 139

Veterans who experience homelessness often share several risk factors and characteristics that make them more
susceptible to this situation.241

1.  **SUDs and MHDs**: These are the strongest and most consistent risk factors for homelessness among
    veterans. Problematic substance use, particularly of illicit drugs, and MHDs such as PTSD significantly
    increase the risk of homelessness.

2.  **Low Income and Financial Instability**: Economic factors, including low income and unemployment,
    are critical risk factors. Veterans with unstable financial conditions are at a higher risk of becoming
    homeless.

3.  **Lack of Social Support**: Isolation and lack of family or social support networks also contribute to
    homelessness among veterans. Those who lack a supportive community are more vulnerable to
    homelessness.

4.  **Adverse Childhood Experiences and Trauma**: Traumatic experiences, both in childhood and during
    military service, such as combat exposure or sexual assault, increase the risk of homelessness. These
    experiences often lead to or exacerbate mental health issues that can lead to homelessness.

5.  **Post Incarceration**: Incarceration can lead to residential displacement, limited employment prospects,
    stigma, and disrupted personal relationships, which can ultimately increase risk for homelessness.

6.  **Veteran Specific Factors**: Veterans who served in the era of the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts have
    shown to be at a greater risk, with specific challenges such as PTSD being prevalent risk factors.

**CULTURE OF THE MILITARY AND HELP-SEEKING**

Military culture is deeply rooted in a set of core values that prioritize strength, discipline, and stoicism. These
values are essential for survival and effectiveness in combat but can stigmatize those who express vulnerabilities
such as mental health or substance use issues. The following barriers can deter service members from seeking
the help they need, leading to potential untreated MHDs and SUDs within this population.

1.  **Stigma and Perceptions of Weakness**: In many military contexts, admitting the need for mental health
    or substance use services is often perceived as a sign of weakness. This perception can lead to significant
    stigma, discouraging individuals from stepping forward to seek help.

2.  **Career Concerns**: Many service members fear that acknowledging a mental health or substance use issue
    could adversely affect their career progression or lead to their discharge from the service. This fear can be
    a powerful deterrent against seeking help.

3.  **Lack of Awareness and Access**: In some cases, military personnel may not be aware of the services
    available to them or may have difficulty accessing these services due to logistical challenges, especially in
    remote or combat areas.

4.  **Soldier Identity**: The strong emphasis on soldier ideals within the military can complicate the willingness
    of service members, particularly men, to admit to struggles with mental health or substance use, as these
    admissions can be seen as incongruent with their identities as soldiers.[Layout: The page has a header at the top.

**IMPLICATIONS FOR TREATMENT**

As reviewed in Chapter 2, the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) have extensive healthcare systems that use a variety of strategies to address SUDs and MHDs among active-duty service members, reservists, and veterans. They have comprehensive clinical guidelines to standardize modern practices for these disorders across their systems. Although the military health system is the primary health care provider for these individuals, the civilian behavioral health treatment system must be prepared to effectively provide needed services for those who access help at the community level.

Community-based, non-military counseling professionals, including SUD counselors, can effectively serve veterans with SUDs and MHDs by adopting a combination of approaches that includes specialized training, cultural competence, integrated treatment models, and collaboration with veteran-specific resources. Here are some examples:

1.  **Specialized Training**: Professionals should seek training that focuses specifically on the unique aspects of military culture and the common mental health challenges faced by veterans, particularly for PTSD, depression, and anxiety.

2.  **Cultural Competence**: Understanding military culture is critical. Counselors should familiarize themselves with the military’s structure, values, and common experiences, such as the significance of camaraderie and the impact of combat exposure. This understanding can help in building trust and rapport with veteran clients.

3.  **Integrated Treatment Approaches**: Since SUDs and MHDs often occur together, it’s important for counselors to use integrated treatment plans and strategies that address both issues simultaneously. This might include combining evidence-based treatments with medication management, addressing underlying trauma, and developing coping strategies.

4.  **Trauma-Informed Care**: Many veterans may have experienced traumatic events, both in and out of military settings. Adopting a trauma-informed care approach ensures that therapists provide treatment that acknowledges the role of trauma to help in creating a safe environment for veterans to discuss their experiences.

5.  **Collaboration with Veteran Services**: Establishing connections with local VA centers and veteran organizations can provide additional support and resources. These partnerships can facilitate referrals, provide access to specialized programs, and support comprehensive care plans tailored to veterans’ specific needs.

6.  **Peer Support Programs**: Encouraging linkage with a Peer Specialist and participation in or facilitating peer support groups can be beneficial. Mutual-help groups offer a space where veterans can share experiences and recovery strategies with others who have faced similar challenges.

CHAPTER 3: Co-Occurring Conditions and Special Populations 141

7. **Continuing Education:** Ongoing education about the latest research and best practices in treating veterans with SUDs and MHDs is vital for therapists to stay effective. This includes staying informed about developments in medications, therapies, and holistic approaches specific to this population.

By embracing these strategies, SUD counselors can significantly improve their effectiveness in treating veterans, ultimately helping them to integrate successfully into civilian life and manage their mental health and substance use challenges.

**SUMMARY**

This chapter emphasizes the prevalence and complexity of overlapping conditions such as SUDs, MHDs, and physical health issues. These co-occurring disorders are significant and often interact in ways that can exacerbate each other, complicating both diagnosis and treatment. The interrelated nature of these conditions highlights the need for integrated healthcare approaches that address all aspects of a person's health simultaneously. By treating the whole person rather than isolated symptoms or disorders, SUD counselors can offer more **effective**, efficient, and holistic care. This is particularly important given the high rates of comorbidity observed among these disorders.

The chapter introduces the characteristics of several diverse population groups and explores the barriers that can hinder their access to quality healthcare. These barriers are particularly difficult for individuals from marginalized communities. Common issues or barriers experienced among special population groups were noted, such as higher rates of both SUDs and MHDs compared to the general population; stigma and discrimination; potential economic hardship; multiple issues with social determinants of health that lead to increased vulnerability; and service encounters with providers who may lack the training to fully understand their specific needs and situations.

SUD counselors have an important role in the healthcare team. While they aren’t expected to be the lead clinician in certain areas (medical, psychiatric, etc.), they are expected to have a holistic perspective and contribute to/facilitate integrated treatment approaches to ensure that care is comprehensive and tailored to address the multifaceted needs of each client.
