language whenever possible in writing the objective. In addition, it is best to use wording for objectives
that address a positive change for the future instead of what the client wants to stop doing. Here are other
considerations when crafting objectives:

» What will the client do that indicates that a goal is attained?
» Is the criteria for measurement a part of the objective statement?
» Is the objective realistic – is it something that the client really can achieve?
» Does the objective have a singular focus, so it is clear?

Throughout the course of care, goals may remain the same. Objectives, however, need continual monitoring and
revision or discontinuation. When an objective is discontinued, make sure to notate why it has been discontinued
or if it was achieved. **Action steps** might also accompany objectives to further define interventions. These steps
are listed along with whom, how, and when the step will be accomplished.

In summary, setting measurable, attainable, and realistic goals is a fundamental part of creating an effective
treatment plan for SUDs. It not only guides the treatment process but also supports the client’s journey towards
recovery by providing direction, motivation, and a framework for evaluating progress.

**Example of Writing Objectives within a SMART Goal**

*NOTE: This scenario assumes the client has completed any educational prerequisites needed for a welding apprenticeship
program. When writing a goal or objective an actual date for accomplishment is used; this example does not include dates,
only estimations of time for illustrative purposes.*

**SMART Goal:**
(Client name) will apply for an apprenticeship program for welding within the
next four months.

**Objectives:**
1. Within the first 30 days, (client) will research and compile a list of at least five welding apprenticeship
programs, including details on application requirements, program length, and associated costs.
2. Within the first 60 days, (client) will review and select which welding apprenticeship program or
programs that will be applied to.
3. Within 120 days, (client) will assemble all necessary application materials, including updating a
resume to highlight relevant skills and experiences, writing a cover letter tailored to each program, and
gathering any required recommendations.
4. Before the end of the four-month period, (client) will submit applications to all selected apprenticeship
programs.

Each objective can have related action steps, such as conduct online research for welding apprenticeships,
take a resume writing class, and get feedback on accuracy and completeness of application materials.
