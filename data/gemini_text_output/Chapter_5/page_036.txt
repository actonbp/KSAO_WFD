**Steps in Crisis Intervention**

Crisis intervention is a process by which a response team or individual identifies, assesses, and intervenes with the person in crisis to return the individual to their prior level of functioning as quickly as possible and to lessen any negative impact. When applied effectively this process results in the acquisition of new skills and coping mechanisms, leading to positive change.

Crisis intervention requires that the person experiencing crisis receive timely and skillful support to help cope with their situation before further physical or emotional deterioration occurs. Crisis responders need to address that person’s distress, impairment, and instability by operating in a logical and orderly process as dictated by a valid, systematic crisis intervention model. The use of a comprehensive model allows the novice as well as the experienced clinician to be mindful of maintaining the fine line that allows for a response that is active and directive enough but does not take problem ownership away from the client. In general, the following steps are employed:78

» **Assessing the Severity of the Crisis.** The first step in crisis intervention is assessing the severity of the problem. If the person in crisis is physically injured, or violent, some immediate steps need to be taken to safeguard this person and those around them. More typically, the person in crisis is confused, anxious, and unsure of what to do next. This is not an immediate medical emergency. There is some time to assess the problem and deal with solutions.

» **Forming a Connection.** To assist a person in crisis it is necessary to form a human connection or establish rapport with them. The person must feel the responder cares about them and is concerned about the situation. When crisis intervention is done in person, the responder’s body language, facial expressions and eye contact will all convey caring and interest. With crisis intervention done by telephone, only the words used, the tone of voice, the speed of speaking, the loudness of the voice, and the inflection used can convey caring and interest. The initial response to a person in crisis should be a response that demonstrates empathy. This is the communication to the person in crisis that the responder understands the feelings being expressed by the person in crisis.

» **Exploring the Problem.** The next step in crisis intervention is exploring the problem. In crisis intervention it is important to focus on the immediate situation. One of the main differences between crisis intervention and traditional counseling is this emphasis on the present and immediate past. Delving into someone’s unhappy past is not a wise use of time during a crisis intervention. The goal of crisis intervention is to help the person through the immediate crisis by restoring the person to their previous level of functioning. The tools used to explore the problem in a crisis intervention setting are active listening and paraphrasing.

» **Dealing with Feelings and Emotions.** The feelings, not only the content, of the material presented must be examined so that a complete picture of the crisis, through the eyes of the person in the crisis, can be obtained. Many people have difficulty expressing their feelings. When they are in crisis they may seem unaffected or detached and emotionless about their situation. Conversely, there are some individuals who become overly emotional during a crisis. They may be crying or overwrought to an extent that makes communication nearly impossible.

» **Generating Alternative Solutions.** After the counselor has heard a considerable amount of detail regarding the present crisis and the feelings underlying those facts, the best practice is to summarize their understanding of the situation to this point. This step is in preparation for discussing alternative possible solutions. After this summary, the person with the crisis may modify the situation by adding new details, or correcting their interpretation of what the counselor has heard.

» **Development of an Action Plan.** The final step in crisis intervention is the development of an action plan. The action plan lays out the steps that will be taken by the person to resolve the crisis. The action plan needs to be specific, concrete, and in small mutually agreed upon increments. The action plan should be developed by the person in crisis with the assistance of the counselor.
