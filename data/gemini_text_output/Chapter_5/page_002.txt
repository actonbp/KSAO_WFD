[Image: A black and white photograph depicting five individuals in what appears to be a professional meeting or discussion around a wooden table. In the foreground on the left, a woman with dark hair is partially visible. To her right, a man with glasses and a receding hairline, wearing a suit jacket, is looking down at papers he holds and gesturing with his right hand. Behind him and slightly to the left, a woman with lighter hair is standing, looking down and appearing to write on a notepad. To the right of the man with papers, a woman with dark, shoulder-length hair and glasses, wearing a light-colored jacket (possibly a lab coat), is looking towards him and gesturing with her left hand. On the far right, a man with dark hair and glasses, wearing a suit and striped tie, is looking towards the center of the table. On the table, there are papers, pens, a glass of water, and a coffee mug. The image suggests a collaborative professional environment, relevant to the topic of counseling and treatment planning discussed in the text.]
