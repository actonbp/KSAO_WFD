neurofeedback are also gaining attention for their potential to enhance emotional regulation and reduce
cravings.²¹ These evidence-based practices are explored in Chapter 6.

2. **Medications:** Pharmacotherapy (medication-assisted treatment) can be instrumental in relapse
prevention, especially for certain types of substance dependencies such as opioid, alcohol, and nicotine
use disorders. Medications like naltrexone, buprenorphine, and methadone for opioid use disorder, or
disulfiram, naltrexone, and acamprosate for alcohol use disorder, help reduce cravings and normalize
brain function. These medications, when used as part of a comprehensive treatment plan that includes
therapy, can significantly improve outcomes and help maintain sobriety.

3. **Peer Support:** Linkage with a peer specialist or attendance in mutual support groups, such as Alcoholics
Anonymous (AA) or Narcotics Anonymous (NA), offer invaluable social support and encouragement from
individuals who have experienced similar challenges. The shared experiences and collective wisdom found
in peer support groups can empower individuals in recovery, providing them with strategies to cope with
cravings, triggers, and the stresses of daily life without resorting to substance use. Peer support also
fosters a sense of belonging and community, which is essential for emotional well-being and recovery.

4. **Monitoring:** Regular monitoring, including drug testing, can be an effective component of a relapse
prevention plan. It serves both as a deterrent to substance use and as an early detection method for
relapse, allowing for prompt intervention. Monitoring is often used in conjunction with recovery
programs and can be tailored to fit the individual's needs, providing accountability and support
throughout the recovery journey.

5. **Emerging Interventions:** Innovative approaches to relapse prevention are continually being developed and
researched. These include digital interventions such as smartphone apps designed to support recovery
by offering resources, reminders, and access to support networks. An emerging area is the use of virtual
reality (VR) technology in combination with mindfulness-based interventions to simulate high-risk
situations in a controlled environment, allowing individuals to practice coping strategies.²², ²³

Tailoring these strategies to meet the individual needs of those in recovery is crucial, as is ongoing evaluation
and adjustment of the relapse prevention plan to ensure it remains effective over time.

**RECOVERY PLANNING**

Recovery and treatment planning are
complementary components. The concept of
recovery planning was introduced over two
decades ago.²⁴ It delineated a dichotomy in which
professional staff at medical model programs
controlled the treatment planning process and its
implementation against practices in which clients
were more directly responsible for developing
their own recovery plans, within a context of
help from peers and recovering staff. Like other
traditional practices that have morphed and
evolved, so has the concept of recovery planning.

Today, the terms "treatment planning" and
"recovery planning" are often used in the same
context and can overlap in goals and objectives.
Both plans serve as foundational strategies aimed
at guiding individuals towards recovery and
improved well-being. As noted in this chapter,
treatment plans are now guided by modern
philosophies of person-centered care – plans are

WRAP²⁷

The Wellness Recovery Action Plan (WRAP) is a self-
management and recovery system developed by a group of
people who were searching for ways to overcome their own
mental health issues and move on to fulfilling their life dreams
and goals. It is a structured system for monitoring behavioral
health conditions, and, through planned responses, reducing,
modifying, or eliminating those problematic behaviors
or symptoms. It emphasizes personal responsibility, self-
advocacy, education, and support.

WRAP was developed in 1997 by Mary Ellen Copeland and a
group of peers in Vermont, USA. It is based on the principle that
people who have various health challenges can find ways to
manage their conditions and move towards recovery.
