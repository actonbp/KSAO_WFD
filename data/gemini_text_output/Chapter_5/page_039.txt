CHAPTER 5: Treatment Planning and Counseling 255

discussing the reasons for termination, emphasizing the progress made, and reassuring the client of their continued worthiness of support and care.

Ultimately, the counselor’s actions during the discharge or termination phase are guided by a deep commitment to the client’s long-term well-being. By carefully planning the transition, connecting the client with resources, and reinforcing their coping skills and self-efficacy, the counselor lays the groundwork for a successful continuation of the recovery journey beyond the confines of the treatment program. By adhering to best practices, such as early preparation, ethical consideration, effective communication, emotional support, and post-termination planning, counselors can facilitate a positive and empowering termination process. Ultimately, the goal is to ensure that clients feel prepared, supported, and confident in their ability to maintain their progress independently.

**Discharge Plan**

There has been a shift in focus in recent years to be more attentive to the continuing care phase of treatment (or, levels of care). The continuing care phase involves providing some form of less-intensive, tapered care (e.g., standard outpatient treatment, community-based self-help/support groups). The overarching goal of any continuing care model is to sustain treatment gains attained in the primary phase to manage problematic substance use, reach goals of stable housing, recovery, self-sufficiency, and increase quality of life.

Many terms are used to describe the period after primary treatment services – aftercare, continuing care, or discharge. Organizations vary in the terms used; however, the same types of information and plans are usually interchangeable. As seen earlier in this study guide, recovery planning should be a component of the primary treatment phase and the recovery plan should be continually updated, including at the time of discharge. The recovery plan may be a separate document or one-in-the-same as the discharge plan.

Discharge planning may vary widely in its extent and formality, depending on a client’s needs and resources available to support this process. It results in a written plan, and often is developed by one individual, typically the counselor working most closely with the client. Ideally, discharge planning is performed by a planning team that includes the client, family members when appropriate, a community caseworker, resource specialists, and representatives from community service providers.⁸⁵

The purpose of the discharge plan is to summarize the services delivered, the progress towards meeting goals and objectives, and any recommendations post discharge, including continuing care and recovery supports. Discharge, despite taking place at the end of a treatment program, should be a core consideration from the very beginning of the course of services. Early, effective planning facilitates the transition from primary treatment to other services and support is critical for long-term recovery.

Good discharge planning is recovery-oriented, focusing on the client’s recovery capital and services/supports in the areas of health, home, purpose, and community. For example, it weaves together people and agencies who provide ongoing SUD services, linkages recovery communities, stable and permanent housing, community services (e.g., health, transportation, work, medication management, etc.) to support recovery and a “life worth living.”

The discharge plan is person-centered in the identification of post-treatment activities, support groups, referrals, and any other necessary follow-up activities that will support and enhance client progress following discharge.
