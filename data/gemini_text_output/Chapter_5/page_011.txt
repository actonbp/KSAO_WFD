**Warning signs** of recurrence often precede triggers. These warning signs can be categorized as emotional,
mental, and behavioral. Being aware of these warning signs can help SUD counselors identify when clients in
recovery may need more support.

**Emotional warning signs include:**
» Feeling shame or guilt
» Not expressing emotions
» Becoming socially withdrawn
» Becoming uncommunicative, such as at mutual-help meetings

**Mental warning signs include:**
» Craving substances
» Downplaying the effects of past use or fantasizing about past use
» Bargaining with oneself about use
» Considering ways to control use
» Looking for recurrence opportunities
» Planning a recurrence

**Behavioral warning signs include:**
» Not maintaining healthy boundaries
» Not seeking support
» Not practicing self-care, including physical self-care like healthy sleeping and eating
» Not going to mutual-help meetings
» Reengaging with people, places, and things associated with past use

Traditional “relapse prevention” programs have been geared to help individuals improve self-control through
the combination of behavioral skills training, cognitive interventions, and lifestyle change procedures.19 The goal
is to teach individuals how to anticipate and cope with relapse (recurrence). Strategies centered on identifying
high-risk situations and developing strategies to avoid relapse triggers are still the primary focus; however,
relapse prevention programs have grown to include a broader range of techniques and approaches.

1.  **Therapeutic Interventions.** Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a cornerstone in the treatment
    of SUDs, emphasizing the role of cognition (ways of thinking) in substance use and recurrence/
    relapse. Programs have integrated CBT techniques to help individuals identify and challenge thoughts,
    develop coping strategies for dealing with cravings and triggers, and improve problem-solving skills.
    Motivational Interviewing (MI) has been incorporated into relapse prevention programs to address
    ambivalence towards change and enhance motivation for recovery.20 Mindfulness-based interventions and
