**Countertransference**, on the other hand, involves the counselor’s emotional responses to the client’s transference. Countertransference was initially seen as an obstacle to counseling but is now recognized as a vital tool for understanding the client’s relational patterns. It is considered to be a normal part of the counselor’s treatment experience. Particularly when working with clients who have complicated and co-occurring problems, counselors are as vulnerable as clients to feelings of pessimism, despair, and anger, as well as desires to abandon treatment. Less experienced counselors may find it harder to identify countertransference, access feelings evoked by interactions with clients, name those feelings, and keep feelings from interfering with the counseling relationship.49 The counselor’s awareness and management of their own emotional reactions can significantly impact the therapeutic process, enhancing empathy and insight.50

Working with clients with co-occurring conditions may raise countertransference issues. Because people with SUDs and MHDs are highly stigmatized by the public, stigma can also be present among counselors. For example, mental health counselors who usually do not treat people with SUDs may not have worked out their own feelings about problematic substance use, which can influence their interactions with these clients. SUD counselors working with clients who have mental health conditions may have more negative beliefs about and express more negative attitudes towards these clients. These negative attitudes toward clients can have a significant impact on treatment services and outcomes. For example, countertransference may result in counselors failing to offer timely, appropriate treatment or having poor communication with clients. In both instances, counselors need to self-reflect to understand their responses and can benefit from working with supervisors to uncover and correct underlying harmful thoughts and attitudes.
