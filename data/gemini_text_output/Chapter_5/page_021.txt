CHAPTER 5: Treatment Planning and Counseling 237

**Individual Counseling**

Individual counseling is a one-on-one, collaborative process between a counselor and a client where the client can explore their feelings, beliefs, and behaviors. It is a vital component of SUD services, offering a personalized and flexible approach to support individuals in achieving their recovery, health, and wellness goals. Within a supportive and confidential space for self-disclosure, individual counseling can facilitate a deep, personal understanding and encourage self-discovery and personal growth. The foundation of individual counseling is the therapeutic relationship should be built on trust, empathy, and unconditional positive regard.⁶ Counselors can employ a variety of evidence-based techniques and interventions tailored to the client's goals and needs.

**Family Counseling**⁵², ⁵³

Family and social support are important to long-term recovery for people who have problematic substance use or SUDs. Substance use can affect the entire family in significant ways. Families experience hardships, losses, and trauma because of problematic substance use of a loved one.⁵⁴ For example, couples affected by problematic substance use exhibit worse relationship functioning, more frequent intimate partner violence, and greater risk of marital dissolution.⁵⁵ As such, families should be included in treatment and recovery services (with the client's permission). Research has shown that clients with social systems supportive of treatment are more likely to enter treatment, complete treatment, and have better outcomes. Family-based interventions, therefore, are considered among the most effective approaches for treating SUDs and are widely used to support recovery.⁵⁶

Family counseling includes a series of family-based interventions that use family dynamics and strengths to address challenges. It addresses the dynamics within family units, aiming to improve communication, resolve conflicts, and promote a healthier family environment. Family counseling includes various approaches, such as couples and family counseling, which have been shown to be as effective as individual counseling for a wide range of issues. It can increase motivation for people to sustain recovery and foster healing for family members by providing tools and the support they need.

Family counseling is designed to reduce problematic substance use by altering elements of the family dynamic that directly or indirectly support substance use, while simultaneously improving the quality of family relationships. It can help family members understand:

» How problematic substance use affects the person in recovery.
» How problematic substance use affects the whole family.
» How family members can adjust or change behaviors to support people in recovery on their recovery path.

State laws and rules often dictate who can provide family counseling and may require the counselor to hold a professional license. In SUD treatment organizations, counselors with specific training in family counseling approaches may be permitted to offer targeted support to families dealing with these issues. It is always important to know the types of services an SUD counselor can provide within their scope of practice. If the provision of family counseling in the counselor's setting is not available or if the SUD counselor must be licensed, an unlicensed counselor can usually provide family psychoeducational groups to educate family members and dispel stigma and misconceptions about problematic substance use. This can help support both family members and the person in recovery. Family psychoeducation is addressed later in this chapter.

**Unconditional Positive Regard**

Providing clients with unconditional positive regard from the outset of counseling work with them is a key aspect of strengths-based, person-centered counseling, regardless of the therapeutic approach used. Unconditional positive regard refers to caring about, accepting, and valuing someone regardless of what they do or say.
