**ELEMENTS OF A DISCHARGE PLAN**

While formats will vary among organizations, discharge plans are more complete when they include all of the following:
» Presenting problems/issues and reason for services/reason for discharge
» Treatment goals/methods/outcomes
» Statement of client’s well-being at time of discharge
» Referral sources and ancillary services to address issues affecting stability (e.g., medical, mental health, vocational training, employment, housing, finances, etc.)
» Recovery-specific issues (triggers, relapse prevention, mutual aid groups, social integration, supportive relationships, etc.)
» Signature, date, and SUD counselor credentials

Information describing the reasons for discharge is also included. A brief description of the clients’ status at discharge and prognosis for the future should also be included. As previously noted, recommendations for post discharge activities or services could include participation in continuing care groups, mutual aid meetings, medications at discharge, and referral to other services or practitioners. The plan may also indicate what the client should do in the event of a recurrence or crisis (return for services, contact crisis line, etc.).

**THE COUNSELOR/CLIENT RELATIONSHIP**

As noted above, some clients may experience an emotional response when ending the therapeutic relationship even if there is a mutual agreement that services are no longer necessary. Even if the client has been doing well for some time, the relationship with the counselor can be viewed as a safety net and, without it, evokes uncertainty and concern. This may trigger ambivalence and doubt about the impending change. For the client, this could signal frustration or anxiety about the perceived loss of an existing safety net or an end to the professional relationship that has brought stability and support.

Some clients may even perceive termination as a personal loss or abandonment and grieve the ending relationship. The counselor can normalize these feelings for the client by identifying that these are typical reactions and help the client identify healthy coping skills for managing those thoughts and emotions. The counselor can also discuss with the client how their situation has improved including the client’s increased identification and access to resources, knowledge and utilization of healthy coping skills, and utilization of a healthy support system.⁸⁶ When all is said and done, most people feel better when they have had the opportunity to say goodbye.

On the left, a woman with blonde, wavy hair is smiling and looking towards the right. Next to her, slightly behind, a man with dark hair is also smiling and looking towards the right. On the far right, a third person, mostly out of focus, is seen from the shoulder, shaking hands with the man. This third person is wearing a light-colored blazer. The setting suggests an office or a comfortable room.]
