able to connect with group members on a meaningful level.

**Professional Development and Reflection:** Effective group leaders are committed to ongoing professional
development and reflective practice. They seek out supervision, training, and opportunities for self-reflection to
enhance their skills and effectiveness as leaders. This commitment to personal and professional growth supports
the continuous improvement of the therapeutic environment they create for group members.

**GROUP PROCESS**

All groups go through stages of development. The most
used framework for understanding stages of group
development was introduced in the mid-1960s by Bruce
W. Tuckman. Although many authors have written
variations and enhancements to Tuckman’s work, his
descriptions of *Forming, Storming, Norming, Performing* and
*Adjourning* provide a useful framework.⁶⁰

» **Forming:** In this initial stage, group members are
   introduced. They start to understand the group’s
   purpose and their role within it. Members often
   exhibit polite behavior, and there is a high
   dependency on the leader for guidance and
   direction. Uncertainty and anxiety about the
   group process are common.

» **Storming:** As members begin to assert their
   opinions, conflicts and competition may arise,
   leading to a “storming” phase. This period is
   characterized by struggles for power and status
   within the group. Members may challenge the
   leader, the rules, and each other. The storming
   stage is crucial for the growth of the group, as it
   allows for the airing of differences and the development of more open and trusting relationships.

» **Norming:** After working through conflicts, the group begins to establish norms and roles. Cooperation
   improves, and a sense of camaraderie develops. Members agree on goals and norms, and the group
   develops a stronger identity. There is more sharing of personal information and support within the group,
   leading to stronger bonds and commitment.

» **Performing:** The group reaches a level where it can effectively work towards its goals. Members are
   competent, autonomous, and able to handle decision-making processes without supervision. Interactions
   are more task-oriented and focused on problem-solving. The group has a clear structure and functioning,
   and energy is directed towards task completion and productivity.

» **Adjourning** (or Mourning): This final stage occurs in groups that have a predefined end point. Members
   prepare for disbandment and reflect on their experiences and achievements. There can be feelings of loss
   and sadness as the group concludes. The focus is on wrapping up and acknowledging the group’s work
   and relationships.

These stages are not always linear and can overlap or recur as groups continue to develop and face new
challenges. The counselor’s role is to facilitate progression through these stages, helping the group to navigate
conflicts, establish norms, and achieve its objectives. SAMHSA uses different wording to describe the stages;
however, the flow is the same.⁶¹ The following table provides a summary of the group leader’s primary tasks and
the issues that may arise within the group.
