programs are more likely to engage clients more successfully and achieve better in-treatment and after
treatment outcomes when better alliances are created with clients.”35, 36, 37 In addition, the quality of relationships
developed in the treatment process³⁸ and the recovery-oriented efforts³⁹ made by counselors also serve important
roles in determining success in engagement.

The components listed below summarize the many attitudes and actions that support an effective therapeutic
alliance and contribute to the therapeutic process overall.

1.  **Agreement on Treatment Goals**: The counselor and client must concur on the objectives of treatment.
    This agreement is fundamental to guiding the therapeutic process and ensuring that both parties are
    working towards a common aim.

2.  **Engagement in Treatment Tasks**: The alliance is strengthened by the collaboration on treatment-related
    activities and tasks. This involves the client actively participating in the therapeutic interventions and
    both the counselor and client contributing to the process.

3.  **The Development of a Bond**: The emotional connection between the counselor and the client,
    characterized by mutual trust, respect, and understanding, is a critical component of the therapeutic
    alliance. This bond facilitates a safe space for the client to explore issues, learn, and grow.

4.  **Mutual Respect and Empathy**: For the alliance to be effective, there must be mutual respect and
    understanding between the counselor and client. The counselor’s ability to empathize with the client’s
    experiences is crucial in building a strong alliance.

5.  **Collaboration and Participation**: The therapeutic alliance involves both the counselor and the client
    working together collaboratively. The client’s active participation in the therapy process is essential for
    the success of the treatment.

6.  **Flexibility and Responsiveness**: The counselor must be flexible and responsive to the client’s needs,
    adjusting the treatment approach as necessary. This adaptability contributes to a stronger therapeutic
    alliance by demonstrating the counselor’s commitment to the client’s well-being.

**A NOTE ABOUT CLIENT EXPECTANCY**

Client expectancy in counseling refers to the **preconceived notions or anticipations** clients have about the
counseling process and its outcomes before they begin treatment. Client expectations can be categorized into
two broad categories, outcome expectations (i.e., how beneficial treatment will be) and treatment expectations
(i.e., what will happen in treatment).⁴⁰ To expand, this includes beliefs about the nature of the treatment, the role
of the counselor, the expected outcomes, and the client’s own role and responsibilities within the therapeutic
process. These expectations can significantly impact the counseling process, influencing clients’ engagement,
satisfaction, and the effectiveness of the therapeutic relationship.

Research has shown that client expectations can affect the therapeutic alliance and is a strong predictor of
treatment outcomes. For instance, clients who enter SUD treatment with positive expectations about counseling
are more likely to form a strong therapeutic alliance, which in turn, contributes to better treatment outcomes.⁴¹
Furthermore, common understanding of client-counselor expectations for the relationship can enhance the
working alliance, highlighting the importance of aligning expectations at the outset of the relationship.

Clients’ expectations about counseling can also be influenced by their personal characteristics, previous
experiences with SUD treatment, cultural background, and the information they receive from the counselor or
other sources before treatment begins.⁴² Addressing and managing these expectations early in the counseling
process can help in setting realistic goals, improving the therapeutic alliance, and maximizing the effectiveness
of treatment.
