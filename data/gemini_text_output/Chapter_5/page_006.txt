* **Parenting and Childcare Support**: Women entering treatment are likely to be mothers. For many women, the relationships with their children are highly important. Services that enhance parenting, family/couple relationships and childcare can be a part of the treatment plan.

* **Health and Wellness Programs**: The treatment plan may address physical health, including sexual and reproductive health, are essential, especially for pregnant women with SUDs. Women's services should include access to gynecological care, prenatal care, and education on the impact of substance use on reproductive health. Men might prioritize physical health and fitness, integrating health and wellness programs, or addressing cardio-vascular health.

**5. Timeline and Responsibilities.** This detail is often included in the specific goals and objectives. The timeline outlines the expected duration of treatment and sets milestones for evaluating progress toward the treatment goals. It provides a schedule for when specific interventions will be implemented and when goals and objectives will be reviewed and updated. Details for the responsibilities of both the client and the treatment provider are important to clarify what expected from the client in terms of participation and adherence to the treatment plan, as well as the support and services the provider will offer.

**6. Consent and Confidentiality.** The treatment plan includes a section on consent, where the client acknowledges their agreement with the plan and consents to the proposed treatments. It also outlines the confidentiality policies, ensuring the client understands their rights regarding privacy and information sharing.

**7. Crisis Plan.** A crisis plan may be included to address potential emergencies, such as recurrence of substance use or mental health crises. It outlines steps the client and treatment provider will take in case of a crisis, including contact information for emergency services and support networks.

**8. Review and Adjustment Mechanism.** Finally, the plan incorporates a mechanism for regular review and adjustment. This ensures that the treatment plan remains responsive to the client's evolving needs and progress, allowing for modifications as necessary to optimize treatment outcomes.

**Writing SMART Goals and Objectives**

The creation of measurable, attainable, and realistic long and short-term goals is of utmost importance. First, it lays down a clear direction for the treatment process, offering both the counselor and the client a unified vision of the objectives to be achieved. This clarity helps to boost the client's motivation and engagement with the treatment process. Second, achievable goals serve as milestones that, when reached, reinforce the client's belief in their ability to change, thereby enhancing their motivation further. Third, measurable objectives are essential for the ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the treatment's effectiveness, enabling timely adjustments to the plan based on the client's progress.

There is a tendency to focus on long-term goals related to sustained recovery and the prevention of recurrence of substance use; however, short-term goals provide immediate targets to work toward. Together, they build a foundation for long-term success beyond the immediate treatment period. This dual focus not only guides the immediate treatment process but also supports the client's journey towards a lasting recovery.

The **SMART model** is one example that outlines effective goal setting elements.7

* **Specific** goals clearly identify what the outcome is going to be in a clear, straightforward statement. These often answer questions such as who, what, where, when, why, or how and use action verbs such as develop, implement, coordinate, and plan.

* **Measurable** goals support the specific element by determining detailed outcomes that can be measured with tangible results. Identify how the goal will be measured; this information will determine when the goal is completed.
