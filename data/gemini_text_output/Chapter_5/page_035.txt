to countertransference and negative emotions. This involves recognizing their own susceptibilities, avoiding
retaliatory, argumentative, or defensive behaviors, and not engaging in unproductive interactions with the client.
Such actions by staff can worsen the situation. It’s also crucial for the counselor and other staff to understand
their own limitations when handling agitated individuals, recognizing that these encounters can be demanding.
At times, the most appropriate course of action may involve seeking additional support or intervention.77

Here is an example of the use of de-escalation skills:

**Counselor:** I see that you’re feeling really upset because your family didn’t come to visit. It’s understandable to feel
let down and angry when we’re expecting to see our loved ones, and they don’t show up.

**Client:** Yeah, it’s like they don’t even care! Every time I think things are getting better, something like this happens.
It’s just so frustrating!

**Counselor:** That sounds incredibly painful and disappointing. When we feel neglected by the people we care about,
it can stir up a lot of intense emotions. It’s okay to feel this way, and I’m here to support you through it.

**Client:** It just makes me so angry. I don’t want to deal with this anymore.

**Counselor:** You’re dealing with a lot, and it’s normal to feel overwhelmed. Let’s take a moment to focus on your
breathing and try to calm these intense feelings. Can we try that together?

**Client:** Fine, I’ll try it. But it probably won’t help.

**Counselor:** It’s alright. Just trying is a good step. Let’s take a deep breath in... and slowly let it out. Let’s do a few
more, focusing on the air moving in and out. Sometimes, taking a moment to pause can help us start to feel a little
more grounded.

**Client:** (After several breaths) I guess I feel a little better now. It’s just so hard, you know?

**Counselor:** Absolutely, and it’s okay to feel that way. You’ve taken a big step by expressing your feelings and trying
to manage them. How about we explore some ways you can communicate your feelings to your family or find
support in other ways?

This dialogue demonstrates the use of verbal de-escalation techniques by acknowledging the client’s feelings,
offering support, encouraging calming techniques, and gently steering the conversation towards positive coping
strategies.
