CHAPTER 5: Treatment Planning and Counseling 221

**The Treatment Plan**

The treatment plan is typically crafted through a cooperative effort between the client, the SUD counselor, and a multidisciplinary team. Many organizations may create an early, concise version of the treatment plan (the initial treatment plan), with a more elaborate and thorough plan developed later. The completion timeline for the treatment plan, along with its revisions, is governed by specific regulations and the policies of the organization. Once the plan is formulated, it is routinely revised to reflect the person’s evolving needs and advancements in their conditions.

A comprehensive treatment plan is a detailed document that outlines the strategy for addressing an individual’s substance use and any co-occurring disorders. Like the interpretive summary, there is no standard format for a treatment plan; however, it typically includes many key components or sections that ensure a holistic approach to treatment and recovery.4, 5

1.  **Client Information.** This section includes basic information about the client, such as their name, date of birth, contact information. It may also include information about the client’s support system, such as family or friends.

2.  **Brief Summary.** A concise summary (taken from the interpretive summary) provides an overview of the client’s substance use history, including the substances used, patterns of use, and any previous attempts at recovery. It also covers co-occurring disorders, such as mental health or medical conditions, and assesses the client’s readiness for change. This section forms the basis for understanding the client’s needs and challenges.

3.  **Diagnosis.** Based on the assessment, this section outlines the client’s diagnoses, including the primary substance use disorder and any secondary diagnoses, such as co-occurring mental health disorders (MHDs). The diagnoses are typically based on criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM–5–TR).

4.  **Interventions, Strategies, and Supports.** This section is “the meat” of the treatment plan. It defines the concrete strategies and techniques that will be used to facilitate the client’s progress to achieve their personal goals. This includes a tailored set of interventions and supports, such as individual and group counseling, medication-assisted treatment (MAT), psychoeducation, relapse prevention strategies, linkage to peer support, and referrals to community resources. The interventions are chosen based on their evidence-based effectiveness and relevance to the client’s specific needs.

    This part of the treatment plan is crafted using goals and objectives that are personalized, specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART, as detailed in the following section). Both short-term and long-term objectives are included; short-term objectives address issues that can be achieved relatively quickly to help maintain motivation by providing early successes while also setting a direction for sustained recovery.

It is important to reiterate that treatment plans need to take into consideration special population needs (as described in Chapter 3), such as age, gender, culture, sexual orientation, disability, etc. For example, when developing treatment plans for women and men, the treatment plan may include several gender-related services.6

> **Gender-Specific Group Therapy:** Programs that provide separate counseling groups for men and women can address gender-specific issues more effectively. Women’s groups might focus on topics like trauma, especially from physical or sexual abuse or relationship issues. Men’s groups might address societal pressures, anger management, masculinity norms, and how these impact substance use and recovery.
