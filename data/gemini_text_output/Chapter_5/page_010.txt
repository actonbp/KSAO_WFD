so. Research indicates that people in recovery with higher levels of self-efficacy have a greater likelihood of
achieving their recovery goals.¹⁴ Because self-efficacy is so critical to the recovery process, counselors should
work with clients to ensure they develop these skills.

**Developing a balanced lifestyle, which includes healthy leisure and recreational activities.** Clients need to
learn the value of developing a balanced lifestyle that includes recreational and leisure activities, including
how to incorporate them into their recovery. Leisure activities may offer opportunities for clients to develop or
practice social skills as well as improve mood and reduce cravings for substances. Counselors should provide
psychoeducation that encourages clients to develop recreational or healthy leisure activities, noting that these
can help them feel better during and after active participation in the activity.¹⁵

**Responding safely to recurrences of use to avoid escalation of problematic substance use.** Recurrence of
problematic substance use does happen, and clients should be made aware of this. After the recurrence occurs,
counselors should schedule a meeting to reassure their clients that they can get back on track. Counselors and
their clients should review the events leading up to the recurrence and identify warning signs, including events
of the previous weeks.

**Addressing health and wellness to support recovery, including through healthy nutrition, physical activity, and
sleep.** Counselors can help clients develop new health and wellness goals to support them in their recovery.
These can include setting goals to improve work, education, health, and nutrition; spending time with family,
significant others, and friends; participating in spiritual or cultural activities; or developing new hobbies.

**RECURRENCE OF PROBLEMATIC SUBSTANCE USE¹⁶**

<table><tr><td>**Recurrence** is a return to problematic substance use after a period of resolved substance use-related problems. Many individuals in recovery experience recurrence, although doing so isn't inevitable.</td><td>Just as the concept of recovery has evolved over time, so too has the concept of **recurrence**. A recovery orientation views the recurrence of problematic substance use not as a failure on the part of the client, but as an indication of the need to work with the client on adjusting the treatment plan or recovery plan, or both, as applicable. While the term "relapse" is still widely used, the shift in addressing recurrence in clients with SUDs now focuses more on understanding and preventing the recurrence of substance use by integrating modern strategies and treatments. According to the 2016 Surgeon General's report on addiction, more than 60% of people treated for an SUD have a recurrence within a year of being discharged from treatment—a recurrence rate that the report notes is comparable to those for other chronic diseases like diabetes and asthma.¹⁷ A 2018 study of U.S. adults with any prior SUDs found that the prevalence of past-year persistent use or recurrent SUD was 38.1%.¹⁸</td></tr></table>

Counselors should be aware of common **triggers** linked to recurrence of use. Triggers refer to specific stimuli or
experiences that can increase the likelihood of a person returning to substance use after a period of abstinence.
These triggers can be **external** (environmental or social cues that can provoke cravings or thoughts associated with
substance use) or **internal** (emotions or thoughts that can lead to substance use). Triggers can directly precede a
recurrence or occur months in advance.

Examples of triggers include:
» People, places, and things (such as drug paraphernalia) that a client associates with substance use
» Relationship difficulties, such as with family, friends, or a partner
» Stressful situations
» Cravings or urges
» Anger, loneliness, boredom, or fatigue
» Unaddressed mental health–related conditions
