CHAPTER 5: Treatment Planning and Counseling 233

**Theoretical Approaches**⁴³

The prevailing theoretical approaches in counseling people with SUDs today are diverse and cater to different aspects of recovery from problematic substance use, psychological well-being, and whole-health issues. These approaches are grounded in various psychological theories and research findings. Here are some of the most influential and widely practiced theoretical orientations for counseling practice:

1.  **Cognitive/Behavioral:** This orientation is grounded in the combination of cognitive and behavioral psychological theories. Its theoretical basis lies in the understanding that an individual's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are interconnected, and that altering one of these components can lead to changes in the others. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a short-term, goal-oriented psychotherapy treatment that takes a hands-on, practical approach to problem-solving. It aims to change patterns of thinking or behavior that are behind people's difficulties, and so change the way they feel.

2.  **Psychodynamic:** This theory focuses on the psychological roots of emotional pain. Its basic tenants require a thorough exploration of the client's personality and self-examination, as well as the use of the counselor-client relationship as a window into problematic relationship patterns in the client's life.

3.  **Humanistic:** This orientation includes several therapies that take a more holistic view of the individual, including Person-Centered Therapy (developed by Carl Rogers) and Gestalt Therapy. These approaches emphasize the person's capacity for self-direction and understanding of one's own development in the context of relationships.

4.  **Recovery Orientation:** A recovery-oriented approach to counseling accepts that recovery from problematic substance use has many pathways and works holistically with the individual's chosen recovery goal. That goal could be abstinence, controlled use, or somewhat reduced use. This represents a move away from the traditional approach to addressing problematic substance use which involved acute, episodic, specialized treatment that emphasized abstinence.
