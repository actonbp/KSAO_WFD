DISCHARGE PLANNING AND TERMINATION

The termination phase is important in the counseling of clients SUDs, serving as a critical bridge from intensive therapeutic support to increased self-reliance. Termination strategies should focus on preparation, effective communication combined with emotional support, and post-termination follow-up to ensure a smooth transition for clients. This transition underscores a client’s move towards recovery independence, making the termination phase as significant as the initial stages of counseling.79 Decisions around termination must prioritize the client’s best interest, steering clear of abrupt endings without clinical justification.

Preparing for discharge, while signaling progress, also ushers in a period of adjustment and vulnerability. SUD counselors play a crucial role in ensuring this transition is as smooth and supportive as possible, thereby setting the stage for sustained recovery. As the time for discharge or termination approaches, the counselor begins by engaging the client in reflective conversations about their transition out of primary treatment. This involves reviewing the milestones achieved, the challenges encountered, and the coping strategies developed throughout the treatment process. Such discussions not only reinforce the client’s progress but also bolster their confidence in their ability to manage outside the structured environment of the treatment program.

Simultaneously, the counselor initiates goal-setting sessions focused on post-treatment life. This involves collaboratively identifying realistic, achievable goals that align with the client’s values and aspirations. By setting goals related to personal growth, relationships, career, and health, the counselor helps the client envision a future where they are not defined by their past struggles with substances. An essential part of the discharge planning involves preparing the client for potential triggers and challenges that lie ahead. This may involve revisiting the relapse/recurrence prevention plan, which includes identifying early warning signs, strategies to manage cravings, and steps to take in case of a recurrence. This plan involves leveraging the support systems established during treatment, such as peer support, family, friends, mutual support groups, and ongoing therapeutic interventions. The counselor may also schedule follow-up sessions or check-ins to monitor the client’s adjustment and provide ongoing support as needed.

Termination requires the client to make use of such newly gained assets as self-knowledge, emotional strength, recognition of feelings, and the ability to express the need for autonomy. For some clients, ending treatment is associated with pride and emotional relief.80 For others, this phase brings up various emotional responses, from anxiety to sadness or even resistance. Clear, empathetic communication along with emotional support strategies are fundamental. The counselor needs to support clients through these emotions, bolstering the new skills they have learned, and reinforce self-efficacy, as well as reflecting positive aspects of the therapeutic relationship. Engaging clients in planning their termination reinforces autonomy, helping them see it not as an end but as a transition to a new phase of independence. Such conversations are not only about closure but also about celebrating growth, preparing for future challenges, and ensuring clients are aware of their accomplishments and resilience.81

There are many reasons why clients terminate services. In the best scenario, the client’s termination is a mutually agreed upon cessation of treatment that occurs as a collaborative process between client and counselor. There are unplanned and involuntary discharge circumstances, however, in which the client self-terminates services or is required to leave a program. The term against medical advice (AMA) indicates that a client “left against medical advice or discontinued care.”82 Historically, SUD treatment programs have used the term “administrative discharge (AD)—also referred to as “disciplinary discharge,” “discharge for cause,” or “discharge upon staff request”—which is the adversarial termination of services due to a client’s failure to comply with program rules and expectations.82

Unplanned discharge is a serious problem in behavioral health treatment settings and especially among residential settings. It is important to handle an unplanned discharge as a safety measure as data reflects a host of issues that face clients and their families, such as high rates of symptomatic deterioration, overdose, criminal offending, incarceration, or death.84 In cases where the termination is not voluntary but necessitated by external factors, the counselor needs to take extra care to address any feelings of abandonment or anxiety.
