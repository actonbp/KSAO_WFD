CHAPTER 5: Treatment Planning and Counseling 219

TREATMENT PLANNING

The basis of the client’s treatment plan is the assessment and subsequent interpretive summary. Treatment plans are usually developed once a diagnosis is confirmed, a placement recommendation has been made, and the client has been admitted into an appropriate level of care. The level of care is determined based on the diagnosis of the problem and on the client’s strengths and assets.

Involving clients directly in the treatment planning process is the basis of effective practice, underscoring the importance of a personalized and engaging approach to recovery. The counselor needs to continue to build trust, demonstrate empathy, ensure respect, and create a safe space where open communication can occur. As the SUD counselor and client explore various treatment modalities and recovery strategies together, a person-centered approach dictates that the client’s preferences and readiness for each option are discussed to ensure that the chosen path aligns with their personal values, strengths, and goals.

Developing a treatment plan for SUDs involves a comprehensive approach that integrates philosophical considerations with practical strategies. **While many of these considerations were addressed in Chapter 4, their importance requires reiteration as they relate to treatment planning and counseling.** Here are key considerations:¹,²

**Theoretical Considerations**

1.  **Person-Centered Approach:** Emphasizing the individual’s worth, autonomy, and capacity for self-directed change. The counselor must believe in the client’s potential for recovery and support their journey with empathy and without judgment.
2.  **Holistic Recovery Orientation:** Understanding problematic substance use as a multifaceted issue that affects the person’s physical health, well-being, social relationships, and purpose in life. This perspective connects treatments and supports that address all aspects of the individual’s life (Heath, Home, Purpose, Community).
3.  **Biopsychosocial Model:** Recognizing that SUDs result from a complex interplay of genetic, psychological, and social factors. This model supports the use of diverse treatment modalities to address the varied causes of SUDs.
4.  **Harm Reduction vs. Abstinence:** Philosophically, counselors may need to balance the goal of harm reduction (minimizing the negative consequences of substance use) with the ideal of abstinence, depending on the client’s goals, situation, and readiness for change.
5.  **Ethical Principles:** Upholding confidentiality, informed consent, and the client’s right to self-determination. The counselor must navigate ethical dilemmas with a commitment to do no harm and to respect the dignity and rights of the client.
