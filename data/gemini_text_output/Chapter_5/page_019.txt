CHAPTER 5: Treatment Planning and Counseling 235

**COUNSELING METHODS**

To begin, it is important to address the terms used and their implications. The terms “therapy” and “counseling” in the behavioral health field are often used interchangeably; however, they raise concerns in several areas, primarily concerning the scope, context, and professional identity associated with each term. While both therapy and counseling aim to improve individual well-being, their perceived distinctions and overlapping uses contribute to ongoing discussions among professionals and policymakers.

» **Definition and Scope:** The terms “therapy” and “counseling” can denote different scopes of practice and approaches to treatment. Counseling typically refers to a process focused on facilitating personal and interpersonal functioning across the lifespan, with an emphasis on emotional, social, vocational, educational, health-related, and developmental concerns. One widely agreed upon definition is – _Counseling is a professional relationship that empowers diverse individuals, families, and groups to accomplish mental health, wellness, education, and career goals._⁴⁶
Therapy, or psychotherapy, implies a more intensive process provided by licensed behavioral health professionals. Psychotherapy is a type of treatment that can help individuals experiencing a wide array of behavioral health conditions and emotional challenges. Certain types of psychotherapies can help identify the psychological root causes of one’s condition so a person can function better and have enhanced emotional well-being and healing.⁴⁷ Providers of therapy are typically psychiatrists, psychologists, and licensed clinical social workers, licensed marriage and family therapists, and licensed professional (or mental health) counselors.

» **Professional Identity and Training:** The terms also reflect differences in professional identity and training. For example, individuals providing counseling services might come from a variety of educational backgrounds (social work, psychology, human services, education, nursing, etc.) and may have different levels of academic preparation, training, and licensure/certification. Therapists are typically required to have specific professional qualifications and licensure to diagnose and treat behavioral health conditions. The distinction is significant in terms of the competencies and regulatory standards applicable to each profession.

» **Legal Considerations:** The legal recognition of the terms “therapy” and “counseling” varies by jurisdiction, affecting professional practice, reimbursement, and the legal scope of work. Ethical considerations also arise in the use of these terms, especially concerning clarity in the services offered, informed consent, and the expectations set for clients.

The term “counseling” will be used in this study guide as entry level SUD counselors may or may not have the academic preparation, training, or licensure/certification at the level for “therapy.”

**Understanding Transference and Countertransference**

Before the review of counseling methods, it is important to consider the concepts of “transference” and “countertransference” which reflect the emotional dynamics that occur between the counselor and the client. **Transference** describes the projection of the client’s feelings, attitudes, desires, and expectations from past relationships onto the counselor, often unconsciously. It occurs when a client’s previous experience with other people and with a counselor overlap. For example, the client may regard the counselor as an “authoritative father,” “know-it-all older brother,” or “interfering mother.” Transference plays a critical role in counseling by revealing the client’s unconscious feelings towards significant others, which are redirected towards the counselor. This dynamic offers a valuable window into the client’s internal world, allowing the counselor to address deep-seated issues. If a strong transference develops, it is an important task for the counselor to behave authentically and at the same time with an understanding of the client’s behavior.⁴⁸
