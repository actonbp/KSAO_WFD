personalized, goal-oriented, and involve the active participation of clients
along with a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals.

Recovery planning tends to emphasize client-led initiatives more
strongly, promoting a higher degree of self-management and
empowerment. Clients are encouraged to take a proactive role in crafting
a self-management plan that is both broad in scope (during and after the
primary treatment phase) as well as very specific, much like a relapse/
recurrence prevention plan. The methodologies employed in recovery
planning often include peer support, community engagement, and
activities aimed at enhancing life skills, resilience, and social networks.
Recovery peer support services are integral to this approach, leveraging
the lived experiences of individuals who have successfully navigated their
recovery journey to provide support, mentorship, and guidance.²⁵

Developing a recovery plan is a personalized and dynamic process. It
requires ongoing effort, self-awareness, and the willingness on the
part of the client to adjust strategies based on changing needs and
circumstances. Collaboration with peers, counselors, and support
networks is also important for creating an effective and comprehensive
plan. The types of issues that are usually addressed in recovery planning
include various combinations of these elements:²⁶

Prevent Recurrence of Problematic Substance Use
» Recognize external triggers (events or circumstances) and early
warning signs (subtle internal cues) that may indicate worsening
health.
» Develop strategies for responding to these triggers and signs to
prevent substance use.
» Plan to keep life in balance and ways to reduce stress.
» Identify and plan for high-risk situations.
» Focus on specific actions or thoughts to deal with cravings.

Build a Support Network
» Identify supportive individuals, such as family members, friends,
peers in recovery, and professionals, who can help, encourage,
and be a source of accountability.
» Identify community resources for support such as recovery communities and mutual support groups.
» Spend time in social situations that involve activities that everyone enjoys that does not involve using.

Use Whole Health Strategies
» Compile a list of self-care strategies, personal resources, activities, and practices that improve well-being
— include exercise, hobbies, social activities, relaxation techniques, medication, therapy, and any other
wellness strategies.
» Plan for routine health check-ups.

Create an Action Plan for Crisis Situations
» Have a detailed plan for responding to crises, including when and how to seek help, what treatments to
follow, and who to contact (family, friends, health professionals).
» Outline steps for recovery following a crisis, how to address any lingering issues, and strategies for
preventing future crises.

**Remember, there are many**
**Pathways of Recovery**

Recovery has many pathways, and
it is ultimately up to clients in or
seeking recovery to determine which
pathway or pathways they follow.
Some clients may pursue multiple
approaches to recovery at the same
time or for overlapping periods;
some may try different approaches
in sequence; and some may find a
single approach that works for them
and stick with it.

Some may choose:
> natural recovery through self-
management
> clinical approaches using the
support of a professional
> mutual support through peers
and recovery organizations
> faith-based approaches through
congregation-based support
services
> other unique and personalized
pathways
