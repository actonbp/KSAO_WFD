essential component in many theories and styles of helping, particularly Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
(CBT), Motivational Interviewing, Solution-focused Brief Counseling, etc.

**4. Reflection and Summarization.** With these skills the counselor rephrases the client's statements in their
own words, demonstrating that they are actively listening and understanding the client's message. This
helps to identify and articulate the emotions underlying the client's words; thus, by accurately reflecting
feelings, counselors help clients to explore their emotional experiences more deeply.

**5. Observation.** Effective observation skills enable counselors to gather a wealth of information about
their clients without relying solely on verbal communication. These skills involve attentively noticing
and interpreting a client's non-verbal cues, behaviors, and emotional expressions during counseling
sessions. Observing the client's emotional responses, such as sadness, joy, anger, or fear, can offer clues
to the underlying issues or concerns they might be experiencing. This skill also facilitates the counselor's
analysis of patterns in the client's behavior or emotional responses across sessions, as well as any
discrepancies between what they say and how they behave or react.

**6. Focusing.** Focusing during the counseling session helps clients pay attention to their internal experiences,
emotions, and thoughts that are often outside of their immediate awareness. It involves the counselor's
guiding clients to explore their feelings related to specific issues, allowing for deeper insight, and
understanding of their problems. Focusing is crucial in helping clients identify and articulate their
feelings and thoughts, which can be particularly beneficial in processing and resolving complex emotional
states.

**7. Confrontation.** Confrontation refers to the skill of challenging clients on inconsistencies, contradictions,
or behaviors that are counterproductive to their well-being and goals. This technique helps to bring to
the client's attention to behaviors, thoughts, or feelings that they might not be aware of or are avoiding.
**The goal of confrontation is not to criticize or blame but to encourage self-exploration and foster**
**accountability, leading to personal growth and change.**

**8. Influencing.** This skill involves the counselor's ability to affect clients' perspectives, emotions, or
behaviors in a way that supports their therapeutic goals and promotes positive change. Influencing is
not about directing or controlling the client but about encouraging exploration, insight, and action that
contribute to the client's growth. Influencing also involves helping clients reframe negative or unhelpful
thoughts into more positive or realistic viewpoints. It's about shifting perceptions in a way that opens
new possibilities for coping and problem-solving.

As will be explored in Chapter 6, microskills are emphasized in specific ways in prevailing evidence-based
treatment practices and programs. Having a foundation in these skills facilitates the adoption of effective
treatment approaches. In addition, proficiency in counseling microskills is particularly effective when
working with culturally diverse populations. They can enhance the therapeutic relationship, promote cultural
responsiveness, improve communication, facilitate individualized care, promote empowerment and autonomy,
and help to avoid cultural misinterpretations.³¹

**Therapeutic Alliance**

A good client-counselor relationship is widely recognized as an important component of effective counseling,³²
including counseling people with SUDs.³³, ³⁴ The therapeutic alliance refers to the collaborative relationship
between a counselor and a client. It encompasses the **mutual understanding and agreement on treatment goals,**
**the tasks involved in reaching these goals,** and the **development of a bond** characterized by mutual trust,
respect, and understanding.

Lebow, Kelly and colleagues found "a considerable amount of research literature has identified the powerful role
of the therapeutic alliance in treatment in helping clients enter treatment, remain in treatment longer, to be
confident and explore problems, to experience less distress, and to produce better outcomes. Likewise, treatment
