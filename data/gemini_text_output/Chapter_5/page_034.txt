9. **Substance use.** The problematic use of substances can cause two types of problems - acute, where the client’s judgment is compromised during periods of intoxication, and chronic, where judgment may be impaired more generally. During SUD treatment, a crisis can be precipitated by a reoccurrence of use or overdose.

10. **Chronic pain.** Chronic pain may cause the individual to view suicide as a method for ending pain or it may compromise their judgment.

11. **Poor impulse control.** Certain individuals have poor impulse control because of organic or functional problems. Individuals with a bipolar diagnosis and/or borderline, antisocial, or histrionic personality disorders may have impulse control deficits.

12. **Anger.** When individuals are angry, they appear to lose appropriate problem-solving ability.

13. **New life circumstances.** Changing jobs, marital status, homes, or family status are all stressors that are vulnerability factors.

**Crisis Prevention**

The best way to handle a crisis situation is to prevent it. This involves the use of a wide range of non-physical and verbal strategies focused on preventing and deescalating disruptive behavior. Crisis prevention also involves early assessment of clients for their potential for agitated or assaultive behavior along with the development of appropriate plans of care for managing these behaviors. Strategies aimed at helping clients manage their own behavior, such as stress and anger management groups, can also be effective.

For example, the prevention of violent and aggressive behavior needs to start on admission to a treatment program. In the very first meeting, clients need to be assessed and asked about past violent incidents, whether they have ever been put in seclusion or restraint, whether they have ever experienced abuse as a child or adult, and whether they have ever hurt anyone else. These kinds of questions need to be asked first, since the answers will let staff know who may be at higher risk for conflict and aggression and who may need specialized treatment planning to prevent these incidents.

The SUD counselor and other staff need to be able to recognize **agitation** which can quickly escalate from anxiety to high anxiety, to agitation, to aggression. Agitation is a behavioral pattern that usually is connected to different underlying emotions. When working with an agitated client, there are four main objectives: (1) ensure the safety of the client, staff, and others in the area; (2) help the client manage emotions and distress and maintain or regain control of their behavior; (3) avoid the use of restraint when at all possible; and (4) avoid coercive interventions that escalate agitation.⁷⁶

**VERBAL DE-ESCALATION**

One of the strategies most highly recommended is non-physical “verbal de-escalation.” **Verbal de-escalation** is aimed at meeting the agitated person’s immediate needs, and calming the situation so that it does not escalate, resulting in danger or damage to the individual, program staff or property. This technique involves the use of calm, empathetic communication to de-escalate tension and prevent the situation from worsening. It is essential for counselors and other staff responders to listen actively, validate the individual’s feelings, and use clear, straightforward language to communicate. The effectiveness of verbal de-escalation lies in its ability to reduce anxiety and aggression, thereby preventing the escalation of a crisis.

Clients showing agitation can often present challenges and test the authority, expertise, or qualifications of the staff who are intervening in crisis prevention. To shift focus from their own vulnerabilities, an agitated person is particularly adept at identifying and exploiting the vulnerabilities of the staff responders. To effectively manage these situations, a responder must be adept at acknowledging and managing their own responses
