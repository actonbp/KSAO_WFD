CHAPTER 5: Treatment Planning and Counseling 245

Most people have one predominant learning mode, but some have a balance between two or even all three. Some
people are aware of their preference; they know their “comfort zone”, which helps them approach their own
learning more efficiently. An integrated approach that combines auditory, visual, and kinesthetic strategies can
maximize the effectiveness of psychoeducational interventions. By recognizing and addressing the diverse ways
in which individuals learn, counselors can create more inclusive and effective educational experiences.

**CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE TEACHING**

Teaching from a cultural perspective is more than recognizing that there is a classroom of learners who vary
according to their social and cultural characteristics. **Culturally responsive teaching** is an instructional approach
that recognizes the importance of including learners’ cultural references in all aspects of learning. The term was
coined by researcher Geneva Gay, who wrote that “when academic knowledge and skills are situated within the lived
experiences and frames of reference for students, they are more personally meaningful, have higher interest appeal, and are
learned more easily and thoroughly.”⁶⁵

Geneva Gay’s research highlights the significance of creating inclusive and effective educational environments.
Her work identifies five essential components that collectively form the foundation of culturally responsive
teaching.

1. **Developing a Cultural Diversity Knowledge Base**: Teachers should understand the cultural backgrounds
of their learners. This involves recognizing and valuing the cultural experiences and perspectives learners
bring to their learning environments, including their traditions, languages, and histories.

2. **Including Cultural Representations in Teaching**: The curriculum and teaching materials should reflect the
cultural diversity of the learners. This means incorporating texts, examples, and resources from various
cultures to make learning more relevant and meaningful to all learners.

3. **Designing Culturally Relevant Curriculum**: Beyond just including diverse cultural materials, the
curriculum itself should be designed in a way that it connects with and is relevant to the learners’ own
lives. It should build on their existing knowledge and cultural backgrounds to deepen understanding and
engagement.

4. **Demonstrating Cultural Caring and Building a Learning Community**: Culturally responsive teaching
involves showing respect and care for learners as individuals and as members of various cultural groups.
Creating a supportive and inclusive classroom environment where learners feel valued and understood is
crucial. This also includes establishing high expectations for all learners, providing equitable support to
achieve those expectations.

5. **Communicating with Culturally Responsive Strategies**: Effective communication is key in culturally
responsive teaching. This means employing teaching strategies that are responsive to the cultural norms
of communication of the learners. Teachers should be aware of and sensitive to the linguistic styles and
preferences of their learners, adapting their methods to ensure clear and effective communication.

In the context of psychoeducation, particularly within groups dealing with SUDs and MHDs, culturally
responsive teaching is vital for creating an inclusive, supportive, and effective educational environment. Here
are some pointers for using these the principles of culturally responsive teaching:

* **Understand and acknowledge the rich diversity in cultural backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives
of participants.** This recognition involves appreciating how culture influences individuals’ understanding
of health, illness, recovery, and the meaning they attribute to their experiences with substance use and
mental health.

* **Integrate participants’ cultural knowledge and experiences into the psychoeducational content.** This
might include discussing how cultural beliefs and practices impact substance use and recovery, addressing
stigma within specific cultural contexts, and exploring culturally specific coping mechanisms and support
systems.
