CHAPTER 5: Treatment Planning and Counseling 225

**Issues that Impact Treatment Completion and Recovery**8

SUD counselors should be aware of periods when clients may be more vulnerable to stopping treatment or having a recurrence of problematic substance use. Studies indicate that early treatment, particularly within the first 30 days, may be a challenging period for clients. For example, one study of 5,707 participants in intensive outpatient treatment for an SUD found that 13.8% dropped out before 14 days of treatment, and 31.6% dropped out before 30 days of treatment.9 **Thus, it is critical for counselors to work with clients on the specific issues that may contribute to this increased vulnerability.**

**Understanding cravings.** Being able to identify cravings and manage them is essential for recovery from problematic substance use. Cravings are strong psychological desires to consume a substance or engage in an activity. They are symptoms of abnormal brain adaptations that result from SUDs. The brain becomes accustomed to the presence of a substance, which, when no longer there, produces a powerful desire to obtain and consume it. Clients can be matched to various types of services and interventions can help them manage and reduce cravings, such as medication-assisted treatment (MAT), linkage to peer support, or groups that teach coping strategies to manage cravings, such as recognizing triggers, developing avoidance strategies, and applying problem-solving skills.

**Managing withdrawal.** Withdrawal includes the physical, cognitive, and affective symptoms that occur after chronic use of a substance is reduced abruptly or stopped among individuals who have developed tolerance to it.¹⁰ One way to help clients manage withdrawal is to offer education about the symptoms and help them develop realistic attitudes toward recovery. Counselors should also be able to direct them to withdrawal management groups to support their recovery, remind them that recovery is a process that may include managing long-term symptoms, and explain to clients that it is normal to not feel fully recovered within the first weeks after reducing use or beginning abstinence. Clients should be reassured that, although symptoms may continue indefinitely, they can be managed. Counselors should advise clients about ways to reduce or cope with symptoms, encouraging them to focus on incremental improvements.¹¹

**Developing coping and stress-management skills.** Helping clients to develop coping and stress management skills can further support their recovery process. Counselors should have focused discussions clients to gain more information about situations or triggers that may have put them at higher risk for recurrence in the past. Once these are identified, the SUD counselor should work with clients to develop specific coping and stress management skills tailored to individual triggers and give them tools to address similar events in the future. Understanding these triggers helps clients use specific strategies for coping with these triggers.¹²

**Enhancing self-efficacy to deal with high-risk situations.** While working towards recovery, individuals with problematic substance use need to develop skills for negotiating high-risk situations for recurrence. Developing this self-efficacy is a key part of this process.

**Self-efficacy** is commonly understood as a person’s belief in their ability to take action to achieve a desired outcome.¹³ In the context of substance use, a person with high self-efficacy has confidence in their ability to abstain or reduce such use in high-risk situations. An individual with low self-efficacy, on the other hand, is unsure of their ability to do

**Coping Skills**

*   Learning and practicing stress reduction techniques.
*   Scheduling time for relaxation.

*   Positive reframing occurs when a client considers an alternative positive meaning of or perspective on a situation.

**Avoidance Coping Strategies**

*   Trying not to think about a problem.
*   Distracting oneself with other activities.
*   Avoiding people associated with past substance use.
*   Altering travel routes to avoid triggering places.
