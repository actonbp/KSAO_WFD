CHAPTER 5: Treatment Planning and Counseling 253

The action plan must be very specific regarding time. The person is desperately looking for some relief. To give them hope of moving in a positive direction today, and to see some concrete examples of some resolution by tomorrow will greatly benefit the person. There should also be a specific follow-up plan. If the action steps run into a snag, or if there are unanticipated complications, there needs to be further contact so that the plan can be modified. It is also beneficial to have follow-up to monitor progress.

In summary, SUD counselors are critical team members in crisis prevention and intervention, employing verbal de-escalation techniques and a structured approach to crisis management. Their expertise and empathetic engagement are central in fostering resilience and recovery in individuals facing day-to-day challenges. Anyone who works with agitated clients should receive ongoing crisis prevention and intervention training, particularly in de-escalation techniques. The integration of specialized training and continuous professional development can enhance proficiency in crisis intervention.

In the center, an older man with a white beard and balding head is sitting, looking distressed with his head in his right hand, and holding glasses in his left hand in his lap. A woman on the left, wearing a striped shirt, has her right hand on his left shoulder, offering comfort. A man on the right, wearing a checkered shirt over a t-shirt, has his left hand on the older man's right shoulder, also appearing to offer support. All three are seated.
