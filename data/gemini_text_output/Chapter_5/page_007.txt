CHAPTER 5: Treatment Planning and Counseling 223

» **A**ttainable goals ensure that
the goal can be realistically
obtained provided current
abilities, resources, and
barriers.

» **R**elevant goals are in line with
the client's current aspirations
and long-term goals. They
address the current challenges
and difficulties for which
services are being sought.

» **T**ime-sensitive goals have
an end date; intermediate
dates may also be found in
the objectives and strategies.
This helps track and monitor
progress and is intended to
help the client to move forward
and not become stagnant. It may also indicate whether current services are still appropriate or new
services need to be employed.

While not everyone is equally ready to make a change, research shows that even the smallest shift that moves an
individual in the right direction is worthwhile, because: »»

» Goal setting helps people clarify their values, make decisions, and monitor their progress.
    » **Long-term goal:** (Client name) will obtain stable, long-term housing within six months of entry into
    case management services.
    » **Short-term goal:** (Client name) will apply to one or more appropriate long-term housing program(s)
    within 60 days of entry into case management services.

» Long-term goals often cannot be reached immediately; they must be broken up into smaller steps.

» Reaching smaller goals improves self-esteem and creates a sense of satisfaction and motivation to
continue to move towards a long-term goal.

To make the treatment plan achievable, goals may need to be prioritized and some goals may get deferred.
Deferred goals can always be addressed later as putting too much in the treatment plan may make it
overwhelming and prevent progress. Goals are usually written starting with “1” or “A” – e.g., Goal 1. (Client name)
will complete an educational program to become a Certified Nursing Assistant.

**OBJECTIVES**

It is important to distinguish between goals and objectives in the context of treatment planning. **Goals** are the
broad outcomes to be achieved, while **objectives** are specific, measurable steps to reach these goals. Objectives
should also follow the SMART criteria. Objectives describe incremental, achievable, and progressive **behaviors**
that will contribute to the achievement of a goal. Objectives should narrow down the goal into specific actions
or milestones. Smaller steps inspire hope by allowing clients to experience change as realistic. For instance,
if the goal is to reduce alcohol use, an objective could be, “Identify triggers for alcohol use and develop coping
strategies in the first two weeks.” This objective specifies the action (identify and develop) and the focus
(triggers and coping strategies).

Objectives also indicate that goal achievement is an ongoing process. One possible question to ask during
objective development is “What is the first small step that you can take toward making a change?” Use the client’s
