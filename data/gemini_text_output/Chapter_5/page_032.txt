Psychoeducational groups are versatile and can (and should) be tailored to meet the specific needs and interests of their members. By combining education with skill development and peer support, these groups play a vital role in the recovery and well-being of individuals.

**FAMILY PSYCHOEDUCATIONAL GROUPS**

Family psychoeducational groups provide families with the knowledge and skills needed to better understand and support a family member with problematic substance use or SUDs, thereby improving the overall well-being of both the individual and the family unit. Some of the primary goals of psychoeducation are to help family members prevent the individual with SUDS or co-occurring MHDs from have a recurrence of use or symptoms, and to promote their re-integration (if in residential care) into their home and community. To achieve that goal, family psychoeducation programs seek to provide families with the information they need and the coping skills that will help them deal with their loved one's disorder(s).

The room has wooden floors, large windows letting in natural light, and a partially visible brick wall. The individuals are diverse in appearance and are mostly looking towards the center of the circle, suggesting a group discussion or therapy session.]

An associated goal of psychoeducational programs is support for the clients' families. Research indicates that such programs provide support and help family members feel more knowledgeable and better able to cope with their relatives' conditions.⁶⁷ Although the primary focus of family psychoeducation groups is improved client outcomes, essential intermediate goals are to reduce stress and strain, and promote the well-being of the family. Family psychoeducational programs go beyond mere education by directly engaging with clients and their families to enhance communication, reduce stress and burden, and foster a supportive environment.

Family psychoeducation promotes recovery and has shown promising results for a variety of conditions, including severe mental health and substance use disorders.⁶⁸, ⁶⁹ The design and development of family psychoeducational groups follow the same principles and practices involved in balancing content and process in the delivery of meaningful and effective family interventions. These programs contribute to improved outcomes for both individuals and their families, highlighting the critical role of family engagement in the recovery process.
