**THE COUNSELING PROCESS**

The counseling process for SUDs is dynamic and holistic, emphasizing personal growth, healing, and transformation for people served. Through counseling, SUD counselors guide individuals towards recovery, empowerment, and a healthier lifestyle. At its core, the process is about building a strong therapeutic relationship, characterized by trust, empathy, and unconditional positive regard.

To reiterate the aspects of the therapeutic process thus far – the process begins with engagement where SUD counselors establish a connection with their clients. This phase is crucial for building trust and rapport, which are the foundation of effective treatment. Following engagement, a comprehensive assessment is conducted to understand the depth and nature of the client’s substance use, along with any co-occurring disorders, medical, or psychosocial factors. Armed with a thorough understanding of the client’s needs, the counselor collaborates with them to develop a personalized treatment plan. This plan outlines specific, measurable goals and objectives, tailored interventions, and a timeline for achieving these goals.

This section on the counseling process details the intervention phase where the bulk of therapeutic work happens. SUD counselors intertwine theoretical orientations and counseling skills to guide their clients in meeting their goals, offering support, insight, and professional expertise every step of the way. Counselors also employ a variety of evidence-based practices, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Motivational Interviewing (MI), and others, to help clients develop coping skills, enhance motivation, and address underlying issues contributing to problematic substance use. Individual, group, and family counseling, along with psychoeducational and support groups, are traditional therapeutic methods.

**Counseling Microskills**

**Microskills** in counseling refers to the foundational interpersonal communication skills that counselors use to effectively engage with clients, facilitate the therapeutic process, and promote positive outcomes in counseling. These skills are considered “micro” because they represent the basic, elemental techniques that underpin more complex therapeutic interventions.²⁸

Microskills are the building blocks of effective counseling and include a wide range of verbal and non-verbal communication strategies, such as active listening, empathy questioning, reflecting, summarizing, and focusing, among others. Each microskill serves a specific purpose in the counseling session, from establishing rapport and fostering a safe and trusting environment...to eliciting information, understanding the client’s perspective, and facilitating client insight and action. Here are several important counseling microskills:²⁹, ³⁰

1.  **Attending Behavior.** Attending refers to how the counselor presents to the client physically, psychologically, and emotionally. This includes maintaining eye contact, adopting an open and inviting posture, and using appropriate facial expressions to convey interest and empathy. Verbal attending involves staying on topic and focusing on the client’s narrative without interrupting or redirecting prematurely. Attending gestures and actions by the counselor encourage clients to speak more openly and demonstrate the counselor’s engagement with the conversation.

2.  **Listening.** These skills are essential for understanding the client’s perspective. Active listening involves fully concentrating on what is being said rather than just passively ‘hearing’ the message of the speaker. It includes giving full attention to the speaker, understanding their message, responding appropriately, and remembering the information.

3.  **Eliciting and Tracking Skills.** These involve asking open-ended questions, making reflective responses, restatements, and paraphrasing to clarify client statements, which are critical for understanding the client’s perspective and maintaining the flow of the counseling process. Asking questions effectively can steer the conversation in counseling and enrich the client’s responses. In addition, questions are an
