CHAPTER 9: Professional, Ethical and Legal Responsibilities 383

**CONFIDENTIALITY AND INFORMED CONSENT**

Many chapters in this study guide have explored issues and laws related to confidentiality. This chapter looks more closely into the facets of informed consent and addresses confidentiality from the standpoint of the counselor’s ethical responsibility. Informed consent is the process by which clients are informed of their rights regarding treatment, as well as the benefits and risks of treatment. Informed consent is one of the most basic and important concepts in the delivery of ethical services because it establishes the client’s independence and right to self-determination in receiving services.45 In recent years, the concept of informed consent has broadened to include the idea of “person-centered or person-directed care.” This concept focuses on the assumption that the person has the right to choose or refuse treatment; it also defines the parameters of and sets goals for treatment/service outcomes.

**Elements of Informed Consent**

Informed consent is more than signing the right forms. Many states specify requirements for documentation of informed consent at specific points in the treatment process. Truly informed consent goes beyond the initial authorization for treatment and is an on-going collaborative effort between the client and the service team. Critical elements in achieving informed consent are the:

» client’s rational capacity to provide consent
» client’s comprehension of the information presented
» client’s sense of self-determination or voluntariness

A graduated consent process is preferred. Consent during a screening and assessment phase is conducted at that time to address confidentiality and other relevant issues when entry into treatment may be uncertain. At the point of entering treatment services, the standard treatment consent issues include (1) the clinical characteristics of the problem, including diagnosis; (2) treatment recommendations; (3) the risks and benefits of treatment; (4) the financial costs of the intervention; (5) alternative services or interventions should a client refuse the recommended form of care; and (6) freedom to choose or refuse treatment. In SUD treatment, the consent process might also change as clients move from detoxification to a longer-term residential treatment or when beginning intensive outpatient treatment after detoxification. An informed consent process for clients with SUDs means that treatment providers would talk with clients at each juncture in treatment when the focus or modality of treatment is likely to change. Although signatures might not be required at these transitions, clients should agree in principle with each change of focus or modality of care.46

Cultural and linguistic issues are an important, and often overlooked, aspect of obtaining informed consent. Lack of understanding of professional terminology, linguistic barriers, and poor literacy skills may inhibit a client’s true understanding of what is contained in the consent for treatment. Cultural values may also affect a client’s willingness to ask questions as part of the informed consent process. The counselor should make every effort to ensure that consent is truly voluntary and fully informed.

**Ensure Confidentiality of Client Information**

One of the highest legal and ethical charges in helping professions is maintaining client confidentiality. This includes protecting the client’s privacy and guarding information contained in the clinical or service record. Because of the stigma that is still associated with substance use (and mental health) conditions, maintaining privacy and confidentiality is a critical aspect of protecting the client’s welfare. SUD counselors are expected to protect client’s rights to privacy and confidentiality according to best practices when documenting and reviewing records, especially regarding the communication of client information with third parties. This places a
