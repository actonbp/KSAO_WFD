370 IC&RC Alcohol and Drug Counselor (ADC) Certification Examination Study Guide

Many of the ethical principles regarding boundaries focus on the issue of dual relationships. **Dual relationships** refer to relationships outside of the professional role, such as developing a friendship or engaging in a business transaction with clients. Dual relationships can damage a counselor's objectivity or unintentionally exploit a client's dependence on the counselor.

Dual and multiple relationships can be complex requiring counselors to make judgment calls and apply the codes of ethics carefully to specific situations. Dual or multiple relationships can evolve in subtle ways. Some counselors may somewhat innocently establish a form of nonprofessional relationship.¹⁰ Some of the ways this **boundary crossing** is manifested is:
*   Taking phone calls between sessions (if not an emergency or previously agreed upon)
*   Small gifts (giving and accepting)
*   Special fee arrangements or bartering
*   Excessive counselor self-disclosure/disclosure of personal information
*   Saying “yes” rather than “no” (when no is the more appropriate response)
*   Making special allowances for a client
*   Non-emergency meetings outside of the office or after office hours

Although dual relationships are not damaging to clients in all cases, the SUD counselor must be aware that the potential for harm is always present. Errors in judgment often occur when the counselor's own interests become part of the equation. This loss of objectivity is one factor that increases the risk of harm.¹¹

It is essential the SUD counselor set appropriate relationships and ensure they are consistently maintained. This is the responsibility of the professional, not the client. That is not to say that the counselor is responsible if a client intentionally or unintentionally commits a boundary violation; it is the responsibility of the counselor, however, to recognize that the violation has occurred, inform the client of the inappropriate behavior, and identify appropriate solutions.

Many clients have experienced boundary difficulties in their lives, both as a result and outside of behavioral health conditions. This includes unclear or damaged boundaries within the family, in other interpersonal relationships, and social experiences. This makes it all the more critical that appropriate boundaries are defined at the outset of the professional relationship rather than addressing boundaries when a problem arises.

It is important that the SUD counselor not only defines but models clear and appropriate boundaries for the client. Clear boundaries protect both the counselor and the client. Some clients may find the discussion of boundaries uncomfortable, and others may question the need for boundaries. The counselor should make the reason for boundaries clear to the client and secure the agreement to abide by the boundaries that govern their relationship. It can be helpful if some of the boundaries are expressed in terms of the client's rights which may make the discussion more amenable to the client and places more responsibility on the counselor to maintain good boundaries in the relationship.

**SELF-DISCLOSURE**

An SUD counselor should limit sharing personal information to circumstances when doing so is clearly relevant to the client's service goals. Counselors should carefully choose the parts of their experience that are helpful to the client and monitor how this disclosure affects the client relationship.¹² Use of supervision and peer consultation with colleagues helps to ensure that disclosure of personal information is done in the best interest of the client rather than to meet the needs of the counselor. One general rule regarding self-disclosure is that the professional should only reveal information about a personal life problem well after it has been resolved, not while it is an ongoing issue.
