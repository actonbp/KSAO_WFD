responsibility on the counselor to ensure that
there is no unauthorized disclosure of client
information including family members and
other clients receiving services.

The assurance of confidentiality in behavioral
health is a fundamental guarantee, but it is
not an absolute one. There are many state and
federal laws that outline how service providers
must protect medical, mental health, and
substance use information. Laws also outline
circumstances when this protected health
information can be shared. Chapter 4 outlined
the requirements under the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996
(HIPAA), Public Law 104-191.

As a reminder of what has been previously
presented in this study guide, substance
use information has additional protections
and guidelines beyond those afforded to
physical health, and some circumstances
allow information regarding an individual’s
behavioral health to be shared without
consent.

Confidentiality for substance use is considered
so vital that a federal law outlines the
provisions that must be followed. Chapter 42 C.F.R. §1, Part 2 was enacted in 1972 to specifically protect
information regarding substance use. Part 2 was last revised in 2020 to further facilitate better coordination of
care in response to the opioid epidemic while maintaining its confidentiality protections against unauthorized
disclosure and use. This regulation states that, in general, substance use information in clinical records shall
be confidential and may be disclosed only as authorized by law and regulations. Part 2 applies to clients in
any treatment modality or treatment setting, regardless of how treatment is being funded. There are several
summary and guidance documents published by the federal government that describe how this authority is to be
exercised in practice.⁴⁷, ⁴⁸

**Ethical Issues in Confidentiality**

Several ethical issues involving confidentiality frequently arise in the SUD treatment field. Since the laws
protecting clients are more stringent than laws regarding confidentiality of client records in other fields,
counselors must be specifically familiar with these requirements to avoid ethical confusion or dilemmas. Specific
areas of concern are described below.

**DUTY TO WARN/PROTECT**

Protecting public safety is generally viewed as an ethical responsibility for all counselors. Most people believe
that counselors have an obligation or **duty to warn** or protect people if they believe that their client is placing
those people in danger. In this circumstance, the right to confidential treatment must be weighed against
the need to ensure the safety of others. At the beginning of the counseling relationship, the client should be
informed about these limits of confidentiality, including steps that must be taken to protect the public, such
as policies about notification of law enforcement personnel if a habitual DUI offender drives to a counseling
appointment while intoxicated or an incident of child abuse is revealed.
