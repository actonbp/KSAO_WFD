CHAPTER 9: Professional, Ethical and Legal Responsibilities 363

**Ethical Principles**

The foundation of professional ethics encompasses four dimensions that, when brought together, represent the positive ethical ideals and values of the health care and helping professions.²

| Principle | Description | Simply Stated |
|---|---|---|
| **Principle of Respect for Autonomy** | Autonomy refers to the right of the client to retain control over their care. A counselor can suggest or advise, but any actions that attempt to persuade or coerce the client into making a choice are violations of this principle. In the end, the client must be allowed to make their own decisions independently and according to personal values and beliefs - whether the counselor believes these choices are in that client’s best interests. | Have a duty to not interfere with the decisions of competent adults and a duty to empower others who need assistance in making decisions about their care. |
| **Principle of Nonmaleficence** | Non-maleficence is probably the best known of the four principles. In short, it means, “to do no harm.” This principle is intended to be the basis for all counselor decisions and means that consideration must be given to whether other people or society could be harmed by a decision made, even if it is made for the benefit of an individual client. | Must take positive steps to prevent harm. |
| **Principle of Beneficence** | This principle means that counselors must do all they can to benefit the client in each situation. All services recommended must be with the intention to do the most good for the client and must consider the client’s individual circumstances; what is good for one client will not necessary benefit another. | Must develop and maintain a high level of knowledge and skills to ensure that clients receive the most effective services and supports. |
| **Principle of Justice** | The principle of justice states that counselors will uphold applicable laws and legislation when making choices and that there should be an element of fairness in all health care decisions. This also relates to fairness in decisions that relate to equal distribution of scarce resources. | Have an obligation to uphold the law and to work for the benefit of those who may be unfairly treated. |

**Applicable Laws and Regulations**

At the core of the SUD counselor’s work is the interplay of ethical codes with standards of practice and laws, rules, and regulations governing professional practice. It is often said that **legal** involves the “black and white” of practice requirements, whereas **ethics** is about the “gray” – if not all the shades in between.

Many states regulate the counseling professions with laws that establish defined duties and minimum standards of practice. There may also be additional laws or regulations such as those that are based on whether the SUD counselor is certified or licensed, or an organization’s contracts or accreditations.

**SUD counselors are expected to adhere to federal and jurisdictionally specific rules and regulations regarding best practices in substance use disorder treatment to protect and promote client rights.** In particular, when public funds are used, there is an obligation to fulfill the public trust. This commonly results in publicly funded programs being held to higher standards than the same services offered from the private industry. Ordinarily,
