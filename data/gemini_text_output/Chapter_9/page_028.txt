neglect; and respecting their privacy. Laws also include the rights to comprehensive health, social, educational,
and rehabilitative services without discrimination, and encourage and support self-determination in treatment
and recovery.

The example of client rights described below is common for clients/patients in all health care settings.⁵¹

**Right to Individual Dignity** – The premise of this right is that client/patient is entitled to a certain measure
of personal freedom and cannot be detained against their will (involuntarily) except for a crime or to protect
themselves or others from imminent risk of harm. In addition, clients/patients have a right to participate in the
formulation and review of their treatment plan; and a right to receive services in the least restrictive and most
appropriate setting based on their needs, best interests, and optimum chance for recovery.

**Right to Confidentiality** – The client/patient has a right to have information about their treatment protected as
private. This information may be released only under certain circumstances that include the following:
    »   With the written informed consent of the client/patient.
    »   In case of medical emergency to medical personnel.
    »   To service providers with a need to know.
    »   To the state authority for substance abuse or the Federal Department of Health and Human Services, for
        research.
    »   For audits or evaluations of the provider.
    »   For “good cause” court orders.
    »   For releasing information about crimes on the premises of the treatment program or against treatment
        provider personnel.
    »   For reporting of child abuse and neglect.
    »   By a minor for voluntary admissions and by a minor and guardian for involuntary admissions.

**Right to Information** – There are several areas related to information. The client/patient has the right to:
    »   Know who is providing medical services and is responsible for care.
    »   Know what client/patient support services are available, including if an interpreter is available if the
        person does not speak English.
    »   Know what rules and regulations apply to their conduct.
    »   Be given by the health care provider information such as diagnosis, planned course of treatment,
        alternatives, risks, and prognosis.
    »   Refuse any treatment, except as otherwise provided by law.
    »   Know the health care provider’s or health care facility’s procedures for expressing a grievance and be
        able to express grievances regarding any violation of their rights, as stated in law, through the grievance
        procedure of the health care provider or health care facility which served them and to the appropriate
        state licensing agency.

**Right to Financial Disclosure** – There are several areas related to financial information. The patient has the right
to:
    »   Be given, upon request, full information and necessary counseling on the availability of known financial
        resources for their care.
    »   Know, upon request and in advance of treatment, what type of funding the health care provider or health
        care facility accepts, such as Medicaid or Medicare (if the client/patient is eligible).
    »   Receive, upon request, prior to treatment, a reasonable estimate of charges for medical care.
    »   Receive a copy of a reasonably clear and understandable, itemized bill and, upon request, to have the
        charges explained.

**Right to Non-Discriminatory Services** – Civil rights protections under federal law and most state statutes
specify that an individual may not be denied access to services solely on race, gender, ethnicity, marital status or
disability. In publicly funded agencies, it is also generally a right to receive services regardless of ability to pay.
