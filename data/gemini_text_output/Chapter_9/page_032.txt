**SUMMARY**

This chapter highlights the interplay between legal requirements, ethical practice, and responsiveness to diverse clients as fundamental for professional integrity and effective client care. Counselors must be well-informed about the laws, regulations, and ethical codes that pertain to their practice, and they have the responsibility to address and rectify any ethical breaches they or their peers may commit. Ethical standards are in place to guide counselors on both prescribed and prohibited behaviors, as well as methods for ethical decision-making in daily practice. Ongoing professional development and appropriate supervision play critical roles in maintaining ethical standards.

It also is a part of the counselorâ€™s professional ethics to advocate for and promote diversity, equity, and inclusion. SUD counselors must strive to be adept and sensitive to the diverse cultural backgrounds of their clients and understand how the different cultural groups define health, wellness, SUDs, and recovery. Both cultural humility and cultural competence are essential for ensuring that treatment approaches are inclusive and respectful of all clients, regardless of their background. By embracing these concepts, SUD counselors can enhance their effectiveness, facilitate better client outcomes, and foster an environment where all clients feel understood and valued.
