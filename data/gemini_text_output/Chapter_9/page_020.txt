An awareness of the self is central to the notion of cultural humility. It means admitting that one does not know and is willing to learn from clients about their experiences, while being aware of one’s own culture(s). While competence suggests mastery, humility refers to an intrapersonal and interpersonal approach that cultivates person-centered care.

Thus, **cultural humility** refers to the counselor’s ability to maintain an interpersonal stance that is other-oriented (or open to the other) in relation to aspects of cultural identity that are most important to the client.³⁹ This encompasses the counselor’s openness to accepting that their own cultural identities and experiences will limit their perspective and awareness in understanding the cultural experiences of others. Specific attitudes and practices include openness, respect, consideration, humility, and interest regarding the client’s cultural identity and experiences.⁴⁰

In summary, counselors can develop cultural humility by:
» Practicing self-reflection, including awareness of their beliefs, values, and implicit biases
» Recognizing what they don’t know and being open to learning as much as they can
» Being open to other people’s identities and empathizing with their life experiences
» Acknowledging that the client is their own best authority
» Learning and growing from people whose beliefs, values, and worldviews differ from theirs⁴¹
