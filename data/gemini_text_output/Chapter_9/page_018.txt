> **Achieving health equity** requires actions to increase opportunities for all people to be as healthy as possible. This requires improvements in the conditions that strongly influence health—including good jobs with fair pay, high-quality education, safe housing, good physical and social environments, and high-quality health care—for those who lack access and have worse health.²⁷

» **Social exclusion or marginalization** refers to barring or deterring racial/ethnic or social groups from full participation in society and from sharing the benefits of participation. Socially excluded or marginalized groups have less power and prestige and generally less wealth. Because of that, the places where they live often have health-damaging and/or non-health-promoting conditions, such as pollution, lack of access to jobs and services, and inadequate schools.²⁸

» **Implicit bias** refers to the attitudes or stereotypes that affect our understanding, actions, and decisions. It is the unintentional activation of prejudicial attitudes toward a group based on stereotypes that have receded from consciousness over time and have become invisible to the holder. These attitudes represent overlearned associations with a strong basis that are difficult to completely overwrite with recent experiences or acquired values. Such biases result in an automatic and unconscious reaction and/or behavior.²⁹

» **Intersectionality** is a concept that describes the ways in which systems of inequality based on gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, class, and other forms of discrimination “intersect” to create unique dynamics and effects. All forms of inequality are mutually reinforcing and should examined and addressed simultaneously to prevent one form of inequality from reinforcing another.³⁰

» **Cultural humility** involves understanding the complexity and shifting nature of intersecting identities and recognizing that health care providers will never be fully competent about the evolving and dynamic nature of a client’s experiences. Cultural humility requires an ongoing process of self-exploration and self-critique combined with a willingness to learn from others.³¹ It means entering a relationship with another person with the intention of honoring their beliefs, customs, and values. It means acknowledging differences and accepting that person for who they are.

» **Cultural competence** is a type of social fluency gained by learning about another culture’s language, set of customs, beliefs, and patterns. It enables service providers to tailor their approach to be culturally responsive and sensitive. One early definition identifies cultural competence as the ability to think, feel, and act in ways that acknowledge, respect, and build upon ethnic, socio-cultural, and linguistic diversity.³²
> **Cultural competence** has come to mean more than a discrete skill set or knowledge base; cultural competence also requires self-evaluation on the part of the practitioners. Culturally competent practitioners are aware of their own culture and values, and they acknowledge their own assumptions and biases about other cultures. In addition, they strive to understand how these assumptions affect their ability to provide culturally responsive services to clients from similar or diverse cultures.³³

**Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI)**

Diversity, equity, and inclusion (usually abbreviated DEI) refers to organizational frameworks which seek to promote the fair treatment and full participation of all people, particularly groups who have historically been underrepresented, marginalized, or subject to discrimination based on identity or disability.

» **Diversity** refers to the representation or composition of various social identity groups in a work group, organization, or community.

» **Equity** involves providing resources according to the need to help diverse populations achieve their highest state of health and other functioning. Equity is different than “equality” in that equality implies treating everyone as if their experiences are exactly the same. Equality assumes that everybody is the
