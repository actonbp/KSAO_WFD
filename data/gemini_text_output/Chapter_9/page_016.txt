**CULTURAL RESPONSIVENESS, DIVERSITY, EQUITY, AND INCLUSION**

Current and projected population data for the United States paints a compelling picture and underscores the importance of the need for a service delivery workforce that can serve the needs of individuals from multiple backgrounds. At the present time, the United States is 60.4% white. According to Pew Research Center, the country's racial profile will be vastly different by 2055. Whites will remain the single largest racial group in the US, but they will no longer be the majority. Growth in the Hispanic/Latino and the Asian populations in the US are predicted to almost triple over the next 40 years.22

Individuals often identify initially with broader racial, ethnic, and cultural groups. However, each person has a unique history that warrants an understanding of how culture is practiced and has evolved for the person and his or her family; accordingly, generalizations or assumptions about people should be avoided. Individuals are often part of a culture within a culture. There is not just one Hispanic/Latino, African American, or Native American culture â€“ many variables influence culture and cultural identity.

Offering services that are responsive to current and changing demographics can have far-reaching effects not only for clients, but also for providers and communities. This requires the use of culturally-tailored, inclusive, and affirming approaches. This means offering services and support where everyone, regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disabilities, neurodiversity, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, age, religion, and any other-intersectional identities feels welcome and are treated equitably.

[Image: A stacked bar chart titled "Racial and Ethnic Composition of the United States: 1970 - 2050." The vertical axis represents percentage, ranging from 0 to 100 in increments of 20. The horizontal axis shows years from 1970 to 2050 in increments of 10 years (1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, 2020, 2030, 2040, 2050). Each bar is divided into segments representing different racial and ethnic groups. The chart shows a decreasing proportion of Non-Hispanic White population over time, and increasing proportions of Latino or Hispanic, Asian American, and Other and multiracial populations. The Black or African American population remains relatively stable.
