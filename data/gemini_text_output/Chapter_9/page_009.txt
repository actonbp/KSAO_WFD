CHAPTER 9: Professional, Ethical and Legal Responsibilities
367

**PROFESSIONAL BEHAVIOR**

**Operate in a Competent and Theoretically Sound Manner**

Every profession defines itself by establishing what is called a **scope of practice**. The scope of practice defines the actions that a member of the profession is trained and authorized to perform and may be defined by the credentialing body. SUD counselors have an ethical responsibility to identify and evaluate duties that are both inside and outside of their scope of practice and refer to other professionals as indicated. That is, they should practice within both the limitations of this defined scope as well as their own professional competence. Competence can be indicated by education, experience, training, and credentialing.

Many states have established or mandated a scope(s) of practice for SUD counselors, along with licensing and/ or credentialing requirements. Scopes of practice generally extend from entry level positions requiring a high school diploma or GED through positions that require increased formal degree programs (bachelor, master, doctorate). The types of substance use disorder services and level of professional privileges vary for the various scopes of practice. It is essential that all SUD counselors are aware of the rules, regulations, and the boundaries within which they can work. Violation of the professional scope of practice often results in a loss of licensure or certification and may be pursued legally.

Arrows connect "COMPLIANCE" to various other terms in rectangular boxes. Above "COMPLIANCE", "Governance" and "Standards" are shown, both connected to "COMPLIANCE". To the left of "COMPLIANCE", "Regulations" is connected, which in turn is connected to "Law" above it and "Audit" below it. To the right of "COMPLIANCE", "Risk" is connected, which in turn is connected to "Practices" below it. Below "COMPLIANCE", "Policy" is shown, connected to "COMPLIANCE" and also to "Rules" below it. A finger is pointing towards the "Policy" box. The background behind the tablet is blurred, appearing to be an indoor setting with some grid-like structures.]
