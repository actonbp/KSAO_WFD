**A Word about Culture**

Culture influences many aspects of our lives from how we communicate and celebrate to how we perceive the world around us. Culture involves shared customs, values, social rules of behavior, rituals and traditions, and perceptions of human nature and natural events. Elements of culture are learned from others and may be passed down from generation to generation.

The importance of culture is heightened in the lives of those living in a socio-cultural setting other than the one into which they were born. For people living in their native culture, cultural issues might arise first when they have interactions with individuals who do not share the same culture of origin. These encounters prompt the realization that different cultures view the world in different ways. One way to bridge those differences is through the acquisition of knowledge about other cultures.

**RACE AND ETHNICITY**

Many people equate race and ethnicity with culture; however, the terms "race" and "ethnicity" do not fully define the scope and breadth of culture. Race and ethnicity are the most prominent elements of culture. There are important distinctions between these two terms. For example, many people think of **race** as a biological category based on parentage and associate it with visible physical characteristics such as hair and skin color. Physical features, however, do not reliably differentiate people of different races. For this reason, race is widely used as a social category. Different cultures classify people into racial groups based on a set of characteristics. Often, members of certain social or racial groups are treated as inferior or superior or given unequal access to power and other resources.43

**Ethnicity** refers to a common heritage of a particular group. Elements of this shared heritage include history, language, rituals, and preferences for music and foods. Ethnicity may overlap with race when race is defined as a social category. For example, because Hispanics are an ethnicity, not a race, within that culture, ethnic subgroups such as Cubans and Peruvians include people of different races.

The person in the foreground, on the left, is in sharper focus and appears to be an adult male. He wears a beaded headband, large circular earrings, multiple necklaces, and a patterned garment. His expression is serious, and he looks towards the left. The person in the background, on the right, is slightly out of focus and appears to be a younger individual, possibly a child or young adult. This person also wears a beaded headband and traditional clothing, with braided hair. The background is blurred, suggesting other people or elements of a gathering. The image conveys a sense of cultural tradition and ceremony.]
