RECOVERY BOUNDARIES

Persons in recovery have much to offer in the behavioral health field. Those who have successfully achieved
and maintained recovery can be understanding and successful professionals. The ability to empathize with
clients can be a significant asset. One area of concern is that professionals in recovery may be overly focused on
replicating their own journey to recovery in their work with their clients.¹⁵ For instance, SUD counselors who are
strongly 12-Step oriented may reject treatment approaches that are not abstinence-based. In this circumstance,
clients may also feel pressured to please the counselor by following their example on the road to recovery.

A counselor who has experience with problematic substance use in the past should be secure in recovery before
engaging in a professional relationship with a client. It may be difficult for SUD counselors with a comparatively
short time in recovery to be objective with clients and their clients’ issues may serve as relapse triggers for a
counselor whose sobriety is fragile. Increased consultation and supervision are recommended for professionals
with short histories in recovery.

A counselor who has a recurrence of substance use must face the ethical dilemma of whether to continue
as usual with clients or choose to limit, suspend, or terminate their clinical activities. Appropriate steps to
transition the client to a new SUD counselor should be taken when the affected counselor steps away from their
duties. These decisions should be made within the context of supervision and consultation.

Use Consultation and Supervision

SUD counselors should have a structured process for reviewing their professional skills and addressing
difficulties as they arise. Counselors who are entering new areas of practice and those who are stretching
the boundaries of their skills and experience should have more intensive supervision and consultation. Good
supervision can result in reduced burnout, creativity in resolving difficult cases, and better client care. A regular
assessment of professional skills and development is an important ethical responsibility for SUD counselors and
their agencies.

A variety of definitions for clinical supervision exist. Differences typically reflect aspects of the author’s
discipline and training focus. Bernard and Goodyear¹⁶ offer this definition that has come to be accepted within
the counseling profession:

> Supervision is an intervention that is provided by a senior member of a profession to a junior
> member or members of that same profession. This relationship is evaluative, extends over time,
> and has the simultaneous purposes of enhancing the professional functioning of the junior
> member(s), monitoring the quality of professional services offered to the clients she, he, or they
> see(s), and serving as a gatekeeper of those who are to enter the particular profession.

Simply put...the role of supervision is for counselors to have a place to go to work things out. It is also a place
to be reassured, supported, and to receive helpful and constructive feedback. Having regular supervision can
prevent counselors from “getting stuck” and allows new insights and new energy to move things forward in
clinical work.¹⁷

Supervision is fundamental to the provision of safe, ethical, and competent services. There are many benefits to
having regular and ongoing formal supervision. Supervision...
» is essential to how counselors sustain good practice throughout their working life.
» provides regular and ongoing opportunities to learn, reflect on, and get feedback and support about all
aspects of clinical practice.
» helps to maintain professional and ethical boundaries.
» provides a sounding board to voice concerns, resolve issues, and focus on self-care to avoid burnout.

Supervision can focus on how the counselor is providing services from a clinical perspective as well as an
administrative perspective. Clinically, supervision is the place where the counselor develops their knowledge and
clinical skills (both theoretically and practically), explores specific competencies, and examines their own beliefs
