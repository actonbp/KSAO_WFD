CHAPTER 9: Professional, Ethical and Legal Responsibilities 369

SUD counselors can increase their professional competence by understanding their strengths and weaknesses. It is important to understand that competence in one area doesn’t necessarily translate to another. Counselors with experience in working with adults may not have the skill set to meet the specific needs of an adolescent or an older adult. Counselors should have at least a basic understanding of issues related to substance use, mental health, and trauma issues. In addition, it is important to understand how personal biases, values, experiences, and feelings can enhance client rapport and where they may become a hindrance.

It is important to seek professional development throughout one’s career. Engaging in professional education, training, self-evaluation, supervision, and consultation helps the counselor maintain competence and enhance professional effectiveness. Continuing education helps enhance current skills and knowledge, develop new skills and knowledge, and stay current about the most recent developments in the field including new and evolving evidence-based practices. Continuing education is so important that most states require that certified and licensed professionals, including SUD counselors, receive ongoing continuing education for obtaining and maintaining certification and licensure.

**MAINTAIN APPROPRIATE RELATIONSHIP BOUNDARIES**

Boundaries in a counseling relationship are the often-invisible barriers that affect how the SUD counselor and client interact. **Boundary violations** occur when counselors cross the line of decency and violate or exploit their clients and misuse their power to exploit a client for the counselor’s own benefit. Boundary violations usually involve exploitive business or sexual relationships. Boundary violations are always unethical and are likely to be illegal.

**Boundary crossings** are another issue. They can be ethical or unethical depending upon the actions and intent of the SUD counselor; or they can augment effective interventions such as appropriate self-disclosure, home visits, or non-sexual touch. It is important that SUD counselors differentiate between harmful boundary violations and helpful boundary crossings.⁹
