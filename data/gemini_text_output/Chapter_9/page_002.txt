360 IC&RC Alcohol and Drug Counselor (ADC) Certification Examination Study Guide

**INTRODUCTION**

Substance use disorder (SUD) counselors have mandates for professional and ethical conduct when fulfilling their job responsibilities. Counselors are, first, advocates with the ethical mandate to provide for the right care at the right time in support of health and behavioral health goals determined by the individual and/or the family/ support system. In addition, they are expected to protect and defend the rights of their clients/families, and advance the health, human and social outcomes of the people they serve.

In general, **ethical standards** are developed for the protection of four distinct groups:
» The client
» The professional
» The profession
» The community¹
