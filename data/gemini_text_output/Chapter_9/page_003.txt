CHAPTER 9: Professional, Ethical and Legal Responsibilities 361

[Image: A stylized, angled graphic in the top right quadrant of the page. It features several words in bold, black, serif font on white rectangular pieces of paper arranged in a slightly overlapping, fanned-out manner. The largest and most prominent word is "Ethics". Above and to the left of "Ethics" is the word "Principles", partially obscured. To the right and slightly below "Ethics" are "Valu" (partially obscured, likely "Values") and "Duty". Below "Duty" is the word "Fairnes" (partially obscured, likely "Fairness"). A small portion of another word, possibly starting with "AL" or "VL", is visible at the very bottom left of the graphic.]

The needs of these four groups are not always
clearly understood, articulated, or aligned.
Ethical conflicts and dilemmas arise when
there are unclear or conflicting needs between
the four groups. These conflicts may occur
when it is uncertain which needs or values are
most applicable or conflict with one another.
Mechanisms for resolving such conflicts may
be found in agency policies and procedures,
governing regulations such as licensure rules or
state statutes, and the policies of credentialing/
accrediting bodies (such as the Joint Commission).

It is the responsibility of the counselor to be
knowledgeable about and abide by all laws,
regulations, policies, and ethical codes that apply
to their area of practice. Even though ethical
practices are established for the benefit of the
client, the primary responsibility for ethical
practice and identifying ethical breaches rests
with the professional. In addition, counselors
have a responsibility for self-governance within
the profession – meaning they should be able to
identify and respond appropriately both to their
own ethical breaches and those of their peers.

Even though there is a high degree of commonality between ethical codes used in various helping professionals,
there may be great variation in how those codes are interpreted, monitored, and enforced. It is important to
recognize that many questions related to professional ethics rely on subjective interpretation and that not
everyone involved will agree about whether an ethical breach has occurred in any given situation. The “gray
area” into which many ethical conflicts fall presents a challenge for both the client and the professional. Clear
boundaries and communication between the client and the SUD counselor are essential to help avoid ethical
problems.

Ethical standards both prescribe and prohibit specific behaviors on the part of the counselor. Ethical codes, rules,
and regulations often indicate what a counselor should or must do, while other elements describe what should
not or cannot be done. Often, more attention is paid to the ethical standards that deal with prohibited behavior,
such as breaches of confidentiality or inappropriate touch, than to the prescribed behaviors, such as respect for
diversity, cultural humility, and ongoing professional development. This may be because prohibited behaviors
are perceived to result in greater harm to the client. Failure to act in prescribed ways that are consistent with
best practices and ethical standards, however, may also result in harm to the client, the profession, and the
community. It is important, therefore, to explore all aspects of ethical standards to ensure the greatest good for
all.

SUD counselors also have a professional responsibility to seek and use appropriate supervision and consultation
to improve their professional skills and ensure that they are meeting the needs of their clients. Completing
appropriate continuing professional education courses to improve skills and keep up-to-date with developments
in the field is one of their ethical responsibilities.
