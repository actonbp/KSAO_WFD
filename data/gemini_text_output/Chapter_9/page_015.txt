In the middle ground, a person with glasses, possibly a woman, is seated and looking towards the right, with their hands clasped. In the background on the right, another person with glasses, possibly a woman, is visible from the shoulders up, writing in a spiral-bound notebook. There are laptops and papers on the desk in front of the middle person. The image is slightly out of focus.]

and attitudes regarding clients and the counseling profession.18 From an administrative perspective, supervision
looks at the counselor’s adherence to policies, procedures, and regulations. The counselor has an ethical and
professional responsibility to participate in and comply with both types of supervision and to actively seek out
such supervision if it is not routinely provided.

The nature of supervision encompasses the participants in the relationship, the quality of the relationship
and its purposes. While supervision is not the same thing as counseling, there are many similarities. The core
conditions of counseling — congruence, empathy, and unconditional positive regard — are modeled through
supervisory experience. Factors that make up a successful supervisory relationship typically include: the
structure and character of the supervisory relationship; interpersonal sensitivity; task orientation; social
influence such as expertness, and trustworthiness; a strong working alliance, including agreement of goals and
tasks; and empathy, congruence, and unconditional acceptance.

**CONSULTATION**

Counselors are encouraged to understand and engage in consultation as part of their professional work.
Consultation has similarities to but distinct differences from supervision. A consultation relationship tends to be
nonhierarchical, short-term, freely sought, and nonevaluative. In general, a consultant does not have power and
control over the consultee; in essence the consultant is giving advice.19 In a consultation relationship, there is no
obligation to accept or follow any of the suggestions. Clinical supervision, on the other hand, is more hierarchical
with the supervisor in a position of knowing and being legally responsibility for liability and the actions of the
supervisee.20

Consultation can be sought out with an expert in a specialty area or informally among peers as clinical issues
or dilemmas arise. Peer consultation groups can provide a forum for SUD counselors to meet informally with
peers and colleagues to discuss clinical and practice issues in a supportive and confidential setting. They
are frequently described as small, informal, leaderless, and democratic. peer consultation groups offer both
emotional support and learning opportunities that may be lacking in everyday practice. Consultation groups
serve many functions for the counselor, including the development and refinement of therapeutic skills,
assistance with case conceptualization and treatment, maintenance of ethical standards, and emotional support
for the difficult work of therapy.21
