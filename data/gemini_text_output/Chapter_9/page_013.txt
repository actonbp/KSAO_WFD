One woman, on the left, is facing away from the viewer, her head slightly bowed, with her left hand touching her face. The other woman, on the right, is facing the first woman, looking at her attentively. She is holding a pen and a notepad in her lap, suggesting she is a counselor or therapist. The focus is on their interaction, and the image conveys a sense of seriousness and support. A laptop is partially visible on a desk between them.]

CHAPTER 9: Professional, Ethical and Legal Responsibilities 371

**TOUCH**

The question of appropriate touch within the helping relationships is widely debated. Some codes of ethics may expressly forbid any type of touch between a professional and a client, while others distinguish between intimate and non-intimate physical contact. For example, offering comfort to clients with a non-sexual hug or an arm around their shoulder as they are facing tremendous challenges is often not a question of ethics. It can be considered as a humane action on the part of counselors. On the other hand, touch might be misconstrued as a sexual advance.

SUD counselors, therefore, need to be attuned to their clients and their own intentions. It is important to recognize that many persons with behavioral health diagnoses also have histories of trauma. For these clients, any type of touch within the helping relationship can create significant ethical dilemmas.¹³ Even something as simple as a hug can convey confusing messages to a client with a history of trauma. SUD counselors who have any type of physical contact with clients must have clear boundaries and an awareness that touch may complicate the professional relationship. The counselor must also clearly invite the client to discuss any discomfort that might be caused by unwanted touch and provide enough safety within the relationship that the client can raise this issue if necessary.¹⁴

**SEXUAL RELATIONSHIPS**

There is no ambiguity about the issue of sexual involvement with a client. Sexual or romantic relationships with clients are always improper, even after the professional relationship has ended. The prohibition against this behavior is almost universally incorporated into codes of ethics. As the person with the most power in the relationship, the SUD counselor has the primary responsibility of defining and maintaining this boundary. Many state licensing or certification boards impose significant consequences for professionals who violate this boundary. Sexual or romantic involvement with a client is a serious ethical violation with profound emotional repercussions for the client and significant repercussions for the professional.
