CHAPTER 9: Professional, Ethical and Legal Responsibilities 387

**Right to Quality Services** – Quality services must be based on need (diagnostic and utilization criteria), individualized, administered safely and humanely, with full respect for dignity and integrity, and in accordance with statutory and regulatory requirements.

**Right to Communication** – The client/patient has the right to be told what is happening during the course of care and what decisions are being made on their behalf. In some instances (particularly for correctional programs) and with informed consent, this right may be limited by a provider to ensure a safe, drug-free environment (for example, phone, mail or visitation limitations in early days of treatment).

**Right to Personal Effects** – A provider may take temporary custody of a client’s belongings for safety or medical reasons, but possessions must be returned at the conclusion of treatment.

**Right of Minors to be Educated** – Persons under the age of 18 have the right to receive education based on their needs. This must be coordinated with the local school board. Parents and providers share the responsibility of providing this education.

**Right to Counsel** – For involuntary proceedings, all individuals, both minors and adults, have a right to counsel.

**Right to Habeas Corpus** – This means the right to “have the body” of evidence so that they may examine it and argue against it. In the case of involuntary commitment for evaluation and treatment, the right to habeas corpus means that the client/patient has the right to be told why and upon what evidence the court has decided to commit them against their will.
