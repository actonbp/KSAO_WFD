**OVERVIEW OF PROFESSIONAL ETHICS**

When a new field of practice becomes a recognized profession, members of the profession define their own standards and the ethical parameters under which they will operate. The formal establishment of a code of ethics is a milestone in the development of a particular profession and defines the standards of expected behavior for members of that profession.

Training in professional ethics is required for most state boards that regulate professionals, including SUD counselors. Candidates for certification are often required to sign the code of ethics as part of the certification process. **Codes of ethical conduct** govern many diverse helping professions and help assure a level of professional behavior that can be expected from members of a particular profession. These codes, however, may not provide the practical or detailed guidance needed for dealing with day-to-day situations. Simply following a list of specific rules of conduct does not ensure that the counselor will practice in an ethical manner since any list cannot possibly cover every situation. As a result, it is important that the counselor be schooled in ethical decision making to handle situations that may not be described in the rules or code.
