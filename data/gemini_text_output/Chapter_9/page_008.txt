**Ethical Decision-Making**

SUD counselors are often faced with a balancing act of multiple priorities or conflicts, which can be difficult. Most decisions must be made on a case-by-case basis. There is considerable pressure on service providers to coordinate with multiple stakeholders, and have responsibilities that put them at the forefront of contact with payers and providers. These expectations are complex and, at times, may appear to conflict, requiring judgment and critical thinking skills.⁶ In these situations, attention to ethical issues may a part of the decision-making process.

When deliberation is needed, it is important to identify, to the extent possible, the specifically ethical aspects of the issue at hand. Sometimes what appears to be an ethical dispute is really a dispute about facts or concepts. Making ethical decisions requires sensitivity to the ethical implications of problems and situations. It also requires practice. Having a framework for ethical decision making is essential.⁷

| Steps | Actions |
|---|---|
| **Consider the Parties Involved** | Reflect upon the various individuals and groups who may be affected by your decision. Consider who might be harmed or who might benefit. |
| **Gather all Relevant Information** | Ensure that you have gathered all pertinent information, and that all potential sources of information have been consulted. *.* |
| **Formulate Actions and Consider Alternatives** | Evaluate your decision-making options by asking the following questions: <br> > Which action will produce the “most good” and do the least harm? <br> > Which action respects the rights of all who have a stake in the decision? <br> > Which action treats people equally or proportionately? <br> > Which action serves the community, not just some members? <br> > Which action leads me to act as the sort of person I should be? |
| **Make a Decision and Consider It** | After examining all potential actions, which best addresses the situation? Ask - How do I feel about my choice? |
| **Act** | Many ethical situations are uncomfortable because we can never have all the information. Even so, we must often act. |
| **Reflect on the Outcome** | Evaluate the outcome of your decision. Ask: <br> > What were the results of my decision? <br> > What were the intended and unintended consequences? <br> > Would I change anything now that I have seen the consequences? |
