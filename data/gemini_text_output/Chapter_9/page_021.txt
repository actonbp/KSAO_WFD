CHAPTER 9: Professional, Ethical and Legal Responsibilities 379

**Cultural competence** involves developing cultural knowledge, skills in understanding cross-cultural interactions, and an awareness and acceptance of the dynamic variety of people and populations. Cultural competence has been shown to improve an organization’s sustainability by reinforcing the value of diversity, flexibility, and responsiveness in addressing the current and changing needs of clients, communities, and the healthcare environment. SUD counselors play an important role in the engagement and retention of persons in services. They must have an increased understanding of how individual cultural differences affect substance use, mental health, and help-seeking behavior, and be adequately prepared to deliver effective behavioral health services to diverse individuals.

Counselors can improve their cultural competence and quality of care through:
» Increasing levels of personal awareness, knowledge, and skills
» Improving their capacity to work and communicate effectively in cross-cultural situations
» Learning about their own and others’ cultural identities
» Combating bias and stereotypes
» Respecting others’ beliefs, values, and communication preferences
» Adapting services to each patient’s unique needs
» Gaining new cultural experiences42

Cultural competence is a fundamental ingredient that helps to develop trust, as well as an understanding of the way members of different cultural groups define health, wellness, SUDs, and recovery. A culturally competent model of service provision also acknowledges the client’s cultural strengths, values, and experiences while encouraging behavioral and attitudinal change. Services that are culturally responsive are also characterized by:
» Staff knowledge of the native language of the client
» Staff sensitivity to the cultural nuances of the client population
» Staff backgrounds representative of those of the client population
» Service modalities that reflect the cultural values and treatment needs of the client population
» Representation of the client population in decision-making and policy implementation

Organizations must continually grow their “cultural intelligence” to better understand and respond to the ever-changing needs of their clients and communities. Culturally competent systems include professional behavioral norms for both staff and the organization – norms that are built into the organization’s mission, structure, management, personnel, program design, and treatment protocols.
