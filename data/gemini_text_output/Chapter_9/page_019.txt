same and everybody needs the same thing. Equity focuses on access to or distribution of resources
according to need.34

» **Inclusion** strives for an environment that offers affirmation, celebration, and appreciation of different
approaches, styles, perspectives, and experiences.

These terms are often used in an organizational context. DEI plans and actions seek to make meaningful
changes such as having a diverse workforce, improving the organizational culture to foster an inclusive
environment, creating a strong presence in diverse communities, and providing culturally responsive care.

SUD counselors also must consider how DEI affects their work. Substance use and mental health conditions
affect everyone differently and can be looked at through many lenses. Counselors need to understand how
individual differences affect substance use, mental health, and help-seeking behavior, and be adequately
prepared to deliver effective behavioral health services to diverse individuals. They also must demonstrate
commitments to creating a safe and welcoming environment, to genuineness in the therapeutic relationship, to
understand the cultural nuances of the person’s life, and having a willingness to address any issues created by
cultural and other differences.35

Diversity can be thought of as the “what” clients bring to a counseling relationship. Inclusion can be thought
of as the action or the “how” the counselor responds. Inclusion refers to the action steps taken to **intentionally**
respond to clients and respect and accept people regardless of where they come from, their physical abilities,
how they identify, and what they believe while respecting and accepting them as human beings. **Intentionality**
relates to the importance of being in the moment and responding flexibly to the ever-changing situations and
needs of clients. This art of flexibility needs to be based on solid knowledge, awareness of self and others, and
skills that are then turned into intentional action.36

It also is a part of the counselor’s professional ethics advocate for and to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion.
This begins with the counselor’s ongoing education about DEI issues, policies, practices, and laws. Advocacy can
be at the organizational level to play a part in creating organizational practices reinforce an inclusive culture.
The SUD counselor can also choose to confront the issues that create and reinforce health inequities among the
persons and communities they serve – such as, advocating for fair sentencing laws, or removal bans on specific
federal benefits for persons in recovery, or being a champion for policies that facilitate equitable access to
evidence-based prevention, treatment, harm reduction, and recovery support services.

**Developing Cultural Humility and Cultural Competence**

Stigma, bias, and discrimination on the part of providers may play a key role in perpetuating healthcare
disparities, including in the treatment of problematic substance use.37 With a foundation of cultural humility,
cultural competence and commitment to community engagement, health and behavioral health organizations
and professionals can develop and implement meaningful actions to better address health equity, health
disparities, and health inequities. For SUD counselors, it is important to begin with the fundamental aspects of
cultural humility and cultural competence.

For example, a culturally competent counselor needs to have knowledge and awareness of health-related beliefs,
practices, and cultural values of diverse populations; illness and diagnostic incidence and prevalence among
culturally and ethnically diverse populations; and treatment efficacy data (if any) of culturally and ethnically
diverse populations. A counselor operating with cultural humility must listen with interest and curiosity, have
an awareness of their own possible biases, and attempt a non-judgmental stance about what they hear, and
recognize their inherent status of privilege as a provider and be willing to be taught by their clients/patients.38

The starting point is not an examination of the client’s belief system, but rather requires the SUD counselor to
consider their own assumptions, biases, and beliefs. For example, counselors need to identify any implicit biases
they may have against people with problematic substance use or in recovery, as these biases can have a negative
effect on care and client rapport. If a particular therapeutic approach, such as medication-assisted treatment, is
