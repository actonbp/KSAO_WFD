CHAPTER 9: Professional, Ethical and Legal Responsibilities
385

Duty to warn is more complicated by HIV-related confidentiality issues. Counselors have a duty to educate
clients about the health risks of their specific sex and drug practices without expressing moral judgment, and
to communicate any concerns that arise during treatment. In some circumstances, counselors may offer to help
communicate information to sexual partners of HIV-infected clients. States may have specific procedures for
confidentiality of HIV testing results and for handling records of HIV positive clients. Counselors should be aware
of these procedures so that they can inform their clients how HIV-related information will be handled.

**MINORS AND FAMILIES**

All states require counselors and other helping professionals to report situations that present an imminent risk
of harm to minors. Specific state statutes differ regarding who must make a report, the authority to whom the
report is to be made and the level of evidence required for making a report. Often, it is difficult to determine the
actual level of risk posed to a child. It is important to remember that the SUD counselor should not investigate
the child’s situation or determine how the situation should be handled. This is the responsibility of specially
trained child protective investigators.

In some circumstances, the question of risk to a child may not be clear and counselors must rely on their own
judgment about whether a report should be made. The client may describe difficult or unsafe circumstances,
but then deny that there is any danger to the child. When in doubt, a counselor should seek supervision or
consultation about whether a particular situation is a reportable incident or not. Consultation with another
professional in these situations is extremely valuable in helping a counselor fulfill their ethical responsibility.

Counselors who provide SUD treatment for minors must be clear about how much information will be provided to
parents of their clients. A young person may hesitate to be truthful with a counselor if confidentiality boundaries
are not clear. In the best of circumstances, the counselor will obtain the client’s consent to disclose important
information to the parents. The therapeutic alliance between counselor and client may be damaged if a counselor
who is unclear on the limits of confidentiality later provides information to parents. Counselors should be
familiar with federal laws on confidentiality of SUD abuse records for minor clients, as well as any applicable
state laws, and should seek professional consultation whenever questions arise.49

**Protect Client Rights**

Clients receiving SUD treatment and recovery support services have
specific rights that must be respected. It is the SUD counselor’s
responsibility to inform the client of these rights as well as to safeguard
these rights throughout the course of care. Counselors may need to
serve as an advocate for a client with various other service providers or
systems to ensure that these rights are protected. In some settings or
laws, such as within the criminal justice system, some of these rights are
abbreviated.

Client rights, also referred to as patient rights, are in federal and state
laws to honor and help protect the rights of individuals who have
health conditions that may include substance use and/or mental health
conditions. Diagnosable SUDs are considered disabilities under Section
504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act
(ADA), and Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act50 and are afforded all
protections and rights.

While language may not be exact in all instances, clients’ rights include
being treated with respect; being informed of treatment options;
receiving adequate care and services that meet their needs; refusing
or withdrawing consent for any treatment; being free from abuse and
protections and rights.
