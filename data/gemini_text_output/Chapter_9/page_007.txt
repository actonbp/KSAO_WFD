CHAPTER 9: Professional, Ethical and Legal Responsibilities 365

When compliance with a law or policy is mandatory,
**failure to comply** becomes an ethical issue. There
may be sanctions or consequences associated with
such an ethical breach. One example of this is the
mandatory reporting of suspected abuse or neglect
of a child or vulnerable adult. Professionals who
become aware of potential abuse or neglect in
these populations are required by law to report it
and failure to do so can result in fines and other
disciplinary actions.

SUD counselors may also encounter personal
dilemmas in the professional environment. An
example of a **personal dilemma** within an ethical
context is when a professional engages in a dual
relationship with a client. A dual relationship occurs
when the professional engages in another type of
interaction outside of the service setting such as a
social or business relationship. This includes meeting
for a casual lunch, becoming friends on social media,
and engaging in personal business transactions.
Such dual relationships can lead to role confusion
and blurred boundaries between the two parties. This type of dual relationship may not be specifically forbidden
either in law or outlined in an ethical code of conduct, but it is an unethical practice since it is clearly not in the
best interest of the client.¹

**Ethical or moral dilemmas** in counseling are complex situations where professionals encounter conflicts between
different ethical principles, personal values, and professional obligations. These dilemmas often involve making
difficult decisions that can have significant consequences for both the counselor and the client. Ethical dilemmas
can best be resolved by applying the principles of ethical decision-making. There may be instances of a conflict
in values, when an objective third party must decide which position carries the greater
potential for good or the least potential for harm. The same is true when both positions in an ethical question
are wrong, but one will certainly prevail. In this case, the old axiom, “the lesser of two evils” comes into play to
resolve the conflict. It is important to remember that not acting and doing nothing is often a choice and must be
considered as one of the potential courses of action.

Consider the scenario where an SUD counselor has fervently advocated for specialized service needs for a client
and is denied the service by a higher authority due to competing demands for funds. The counselor feels a strong
sense of responsibility for the client and accountability for client outcomes but does not have authority for the
decision. When the decision is perceived by the counselor to be “inferior ethical prioritizing,” the counselor
experiences a moral dilemma. Repeated incidents such as this put the counselor at risk for **moral distress**. Moral
distress can be manifested as: anger, anxiety, depression, disgust, guilt, sadness, worry, self-blame or doubt,
absenteeism, or even leaving the profession altogether.⁴

**Moral sense** is having a personal understanding of the difference between right and wrong. Moral sense is
developed over time based on life experiences and internalizing values through social learning. Moral sense is
often what we refer to as “conscience,” or the internal voice that tells us right from wrong. People often assume
that their moral sense is healthy, that their values are shared by others, and that their beliefs are correct and
appropriate for professional work.⁵

SUD counselors must continually work to maintain a healthy moral sense and be attuned to possible moral
distress. Because a code of ethics cannot possibly deal with every situation that could potentially occur, it is
important for counselors to have a highly developed moral sense that guides them in their day-to-day behavior.
A general rule is that if an action seems uncomfortable or does not “feel right,” the counselor should seek
supervision or consultation to confirm the ethical constraints and boundaries before taking any further action.
