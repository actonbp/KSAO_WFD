**COMPLAINTS AND GRIEVANCES**

People receiving services in behavioral health organizations have the right to file complaints and grievances with the organization when they are unsatisfied with the services received. Behavioral health organizations must have processes for addressing such client complaints and grievances to comply with federal and/or funder regulations, accreditation standards, protect persons served, and reduce liability.

Clients should be notified of their legal rights upon admission or as soon as possible after admission to care. They should be informed that they have the right to file complaints or grievances regarding their care; that their decision to file complaints or grievances will not compromise the care they will receive; and that all information will be kept confidential. In addition, clients should receive information regarding how to file a grievance or complaint and whom they should contact with such concerns. Some facilities have posted signs in common areas with the contact information of individual whom they can communicate in the event of a complaint or grievance.⁵²

A formal complaints management system encompasses the processes for collecting and analyzing complaints data, as well as how to act upon this information. Two issues are central for managing patient/client complaints. First, is the opportunity for clients to provide feedback on their experiences (e.g., the care they receive, staff expertise, etc.) and to complain when their experiences do not align with their expectations. The second issue surrounds the ability of the management system to adequately analyze, respond to, and use client feedback for service quality improvement.⁵³

**Complaints** stem from minor issues that can typically be resolved by staff present at the time the concern is voiced, while grievances are more serious and generally require investigation into allegations regarding the quality of care. A **grievance** is an expression of dissatisfaction with any aspect of the operations, services, or behavior of a service provider, regardless of whether remedial action is requested. Most grievance procedures require the client file the grievance either verbally or in writing within a specific time frame after the triggering event or incident precipitating the grievance. Examples of grievances include:
*   problems getting an appointment, or having to wait a long time for an appointment.
*   disrespectful or rude behavior by clinical or administrative staff.
*   disagreement with the course of care.

It is important to address both complaints and grievances in a timely and effective manner. The timeliness depends on the issue. For example, complaints can usually be resolved promptly or within 24 hours and involve staff who are present at the time of the complaint. Staff should always try to resolve client complaints or concerns immediately and informally whenever possible. Small issues can escalate if not addressed properly, and people (or their family members or representatives) who feel that their complaints have not been resolved or who have a more in-depth concern may file a formal grievance.⁵⁴ Some organizations have client advocates or representatives whose specific function is to facilitate the care process and help resolve problems the person might face.

Each organization will have specific directives for filing a complaint or grievance. It is the responsibility of the SUD counselor to be aware of these and understand how to guide the person receiving services as indicated in their organization’s policy. Most follow a process like the steps shown below:
*   Any concern, complaint or grievance is to be reported directly to a designated person/unit or made via phone or email.
*   The complaint and/or grievance will be acknowledged upon receipt by the designated person/unit in writing.
*   The details of the grievance will be communicated to supervisory level staff for review and investigation, and the designated person/unit will relay the findings and any follow-up information.
*   Timeframes are established to resolve the grievance with a set number of days, at which time the person will be provided with a written response of resolution of the grievance.
*   Upon completion of the investigative process, all involved parties will receive written notification of the findings and resolution.
