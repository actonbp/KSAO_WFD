there is congruence or consistency between public and private levels of accountability. Sometimes, however,
there are disparities between the various governing requirements or one or more of the areas listed above do not
address the issue at hand. In these circumstances it becomes especially important that the SUD counselor has
a strong ethical orientation along with access to supervision and consultation that can help guide careful and
ethical decision-making.

**CODES OF ETHICS**

A **code of ethics** is a set of principles of conduct within a professional that guide decision making and behavior. The
purpose of the code is to provide members of a specific professional, and other interested persons, with
guidelines for making ethical choices in the conduct of their work. Members of the profession adopt a code of
ethics to share a dedication to ethical behavior and adopt this code to declare their principles and standards of
practice.³

Ethical guidelines are externally defined, however, the will to behave according to these principles is an
internal decision made by the professional. In every interaction with clients, community members, and other
professionals, an SUD counselor makes conscious choices about how to act and interact with others. These
choices not only reflect personal values and standards but must be guided by the external standards that are
imposed by the profession's code of ethics.

Codes can be regarded as blueprints for the relationship between the professional and the client. Professional
ethics reflect what most members of that profession have agreed on in a formal process and "best practices"
rather than reflecting ideal standards that are consistently unattainable. Professional codes of ethics are
necessary and useful, but they have some limitations. For example, it is sometimes easier to identify when
something forbidden has occurred than to verify that everything that is recommended has taken place.

Most codes are general in nature and reflect the consensus of professionals in each field at a single point in time.
This generality, however, can be viewed as vague or confusing to some practitioners. For this reason, certain
issues cannot be handled by ethical codes alone and must be supplemented by laws, regulations, and policies.
In addition, when the practice of a profession is rapidly adapting and evolving, published codes may lag behind
the needs and demands of day-to-day practice. This is why it is important for professionals to understand not
only the listed standards but also the principles that lie behind their respective codes of ethics. This is one area
where the "reasonable person test" (applying common sense) may be used to determine the most ethical course
of action.

While there is **no universally accepted** code of ethics for all counseling professionals, the prevailing codes of
ethics have enough commonalities that we can provide reliable guidance for SUD counselors in this study guide.
Each SUD counselor should be familiar with the codes of ethics from their state, territory, or tribe as well as any
other codes that apply to them.

**Foundations of Ethics**

Ethics are based on moral values — a sense of what is right and wrong. The perception of morality focuses on
the meeting point between personal freedom and the good of broader society. Professional ethics focuses on
the intersection between client rights and professional duties. Ethical conflicts or dilemmas occur when the
perception of what is appropriate conduct within a particular context is unclear or is not clearly communicated
between the parties involved with that interaction. Professionals may respond to ethical questions in different
ways, all of which may be ethically sound.

Ethical conflicts for SUD counselors arise in three basic contexts:

1. Failure to comply with the law, governing policies and ethical codes.
2. Personal dilemmas where the professional knows what is right, but is tempted to do wrong.
3. Moral dilemmas when there are conflicting rights or conflicting wrongs.
