**Clinical Assessments**

A comprehensive biopsychosocial assessment is the foundation upon which the clinical record is built. It entails both data gathering and analysis and the identification of issues and strengths that will provide the basis for treatment. Based on the data gathered and the SUD counselor’s own observations and experience, a clinical summary is formulated.

Key elements to be documented generally include:

1. Referral source and mode of entry (where the client appeared for services)
2. The presenting issue(s)/level of impairment
3. Substance use history (alcohol, drugs, other substances of choice; age of onset: route of administration, frequency; amount and duration of use; consequences; types of previous treatment and response, etc.)
4. Family history (including nature of relationships, history of substance use or mental health conditions, child abuse, legal involvement of family members, etc.)
5. Educational history (academic achievement, learning disabilities, etc.)
6. Employment history/financial status (present and past employment, time frames, vocational interests and plans, etc.)
7. Spiritual and cultural/linguistic considerations (affiliations, values, beliefs, norms, etc.)
8. Medical history (including risk of HIV, Hepatitis, TB)
9. Social history (support networks, peer relationships, living conditions)
10. Legal involvement (arrests, incarcerations, current legal requirements, etc.)
11. Emotional/mental status (current or past mental health disorders, suicide and violence history and risk, past treatment and responses, cognitive functioning, etc.).⁶
12. Client strengths, aptitudes, and preferences (discussed below)
13. Diagnostic impressions, based on DSM–5–TR⁸ (ability to diagnosis may be restricted to licensed practitioners)
14. Problem/needs list
15. Interpretive clinical summary
16. Recommendation for treatment

**MEDICAL DOCUMENTATION**

The type and amount of medical documentation will vary with the type of service provided, the severity of the client’s condition, and the presence of co-occurring conditions. Medically-based interventions, such as detoxification and Medication-Assisted Treatment, will have the most extensive medical documentation. Medical documentation includes the following items:⁹

» Medical history
» Physical examination
» Nursing assessment
» Lab work results
» Records of current and past prescriptions, changes in medications, and medication administration records
» Routine nursing notes

**Treatment Documentation**

The treatment plan for SUDs is a structured strategy designed to address the specific needs of the client. The plan is usually developed by the SUD counselor in collaboration with a team of interdisciplinary professionals. It is developed after a thorough assessment and is regularly updated based on the individual’s progress and changing needs. Many organizations develop an initial treatment plan that is briefer than the full treatment plan which is more detailed and comprehensive. Regulations and organizational policies will dictate the time frame for finalization of the full treatment plan and its updates.
