**Regulations That Apply to Client Records**

There are various regulations that govern the content, scope, and quality of documentation. Agencies construct individual record keeping formats and procedures to meet these expectations. Each of these requires audits from time to time to determine compliance with documentation and other standards. These regulatory bodies include:

» **Single State Authority (SSA) for Substance Use**
Both law and rule based on law serve to protect the public by ensuring that all providers, individual and agency, meet certain minimum standards in providing client care. State laws determine the scope and practice of substance use disorder treatment services. Facility licensing rules define the minimum standards for this treatment, including the content of the clinical record. This includes the time frames that specific documents need to be completed within and who needs to sign and authorize treatment and documents.

» **Accreditation Bodies**
Many agencies voluntarily apply for accreditation with nationally recognized accreditation bodies such the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF) and The Joint Commission. Accreditation standards address quality from an organizational, leadership, and client care perspective. SUD counselors should be familiar with the appropriate standards if their agency is seeking or maintaining accreditation.

» **Third-Party Payers**
Insurance plans that have benefits that pay for substance use disorder treatment services may have specific requirements for documentation. For example, Medicaid may pay for specified treatment services for Medicaid eligible individuals. SUD counselors that document in clinical records should be familiar with Medicaid or other third-party insurer’s documentation requirements, which often include the credentials of the person who can provide or authorize a particular service. Failure to meet these requirements can result in loss of payment or pay backs of previously paid claims.

» **Provider Agencies**
In addition to regulatory standards that may apply, each provider agency has its own expectations and standards for the content and quality of clinical documentation. Often these expectations are detailed in agency specific policy and procedure manuals. SUD counselors that document in the clinical record should be familiar with agency expectations in this area.
