CHAPTER 8: Documentation 347

**Screening Documentation**

Screening occurs in the initial contact with the client. The purpose of screening is to gather enough preliminary information about the client to evaluate a client’s need for services, eligibility for services, the appropriate level of care, and service placement. Screening focuses on current information regarding the presenting problem that resulted in the client seeking services as well as the services that are expected to meet the client’s current needs.

Screening documents review a client’s overall functioning and environment to help determine the need for services, resources, and referrals. While these screenings have different purposes, some organizations choose to have areas of information that overlap. This may be due to documentation requirements or to elicit different information due to the follow-up questions that each discipline would ask.

Documentation from screening instruments and/or interviews typically includes one or more of the following elements.5,6,7

» Presenting problem(s) (reason for services)
» Problem acuity (how much dysfunction or distress is occurring because of the identified problem)
» Referral source (for initial screenings)
» Imminent risk of harm to self and others
» Cognitive and mental status including ability to consent to and participate in treatment
» Psychological functioning including emotional expression and affect
» Current and past symptoms, diagnoses, behaviors, and treatment
» Observed and reported symptoms and behaviors during the interview
» History of trauma
» Family dynamics, relationships, and support systems
» Living conditions and financial security
» Vocational, educational, and legal history
» Current physical health and chronic health conditions
» Drug screening test results
» Any special needs (language, hearing, cultural, etc.)

The visible word on the paper is "Depression," with a comma after it, suggesting more text may follow. The person's right hand is holding a pen and is in the act of writing. The focus is on the hand, pen, and clipboard.]
