Regular updates to the treatment plan are crucial in managing the course of care for people with SUDs. A well-structured plan not only guides the therapeutic process but also ensures individualized care tailored to the specific needs of the client. The integration of detailed documentation in treatment planning facilitates the evaluation of treatment efficacy and enhances the potential for successful recovery outcomes.

**PROGRESS NOTES**

The purpose of the progress note is to **document the client's progress in relation to treatment goals and objectives**. Progress notes document what is occurring through the course of care in relationship to the treatment plan. Specifically, progress notes detail the content of contacts with the client and the client's progress towards accomplishment of goals and objectives, including documentation of process, progress, and outcome measurements. Progress notes also document new information that may be revealed throughout the course of treatment and in some cases may identify additional problems/needs that should be added through treatment plan updates.
