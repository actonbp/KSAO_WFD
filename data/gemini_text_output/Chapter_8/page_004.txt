financial audits, or reviews to ensure compliance with various standards. Information in the clinical
record is compared in financial audits to staff activity logs which document the time, date, duration, and
type of service.

Effective documentation meets the requirements imposed by:
> Applicable federal and state laws, regulations, and rules including those pertaining to relevant
licensing boards.
> Requirements outlined by the parent organization and any affiliated accreditation programs (i.e., The
Joint Commission), health care institutions, facilities, and agencies.
> Various third-party payers (i.e. Medicare, Medicaid, traditional insurance, and managed care plans).

» The clinical record facilitates **quality assurance and utilization review** by:
> Documenting the appropriateness, necessity, and effectiveness of provided services.
> Substantiating changes in services including supporting the addition of services, changes in existing
services, or termination of services (i.e. assessment, testing or treatment).
> Identifying current challenges and barriers in service delivery by providing data with which effective
preventative or corrective actions can be undertaken to improve and assure the quality of care.
> Providing information that is used in organizational policy development, program planning, and
research.
> Providing data for use in planning educational and professional development activities.

» The clinical record **facilitates coordination of professional efforts** by fostering communication and
collaboration between members of the service team. The appropriate utilization of team members from
multiple disciplines helps assure effective coordination of care and prevent fragmented service delivery.
This allows collaboration in an interdisciplinary manner and helps prevent duplicative or conflicting
services.
