Sharing Information within an Agency

Within an agency, information can be shared on a **need-to-know** basis. For instance, a SUD counselor can share information about a client with the program physician who is providing medical services to the client without a signed release of information. Similarly, information can be shared with the SUD counselor’s supervisor who is providing clinical supervision. However, this ability to share information within an agency does not extend to other personnel within the agency who do not function as part of the treatment team.

Client Access

In most states, the law gives the client the right to review their own record. Similarly, the client has the right to request and receive copies of their own records. Most agencies have procedures for how this access occurs. Since there may be information in the record that is technical and/or of a sensitive nature, most agency practices include the primary SUD counselor or supervisor being present with the client when the client record is reviewed to clarify information or respond to questions. SUD counselors should be familiar with these policies and report a client’s request to review a record immediately to the supervisor.

External Parties

In general, clients must provide written consent before information can be released to another party; this stipulation, however, can be overridden under specific circumstances. All SUD counselors should be familiar with state and federal laws as well as agency specific policies and procedures regarding confidentiality, particularly in how it relates to referrals and care coordination (see Chapter 4). Some agencies, for example, may have policies and procedures regarding which staff members can release verbal and written information from the client record. This helps ensure that the release of information has all the required elements and only the permitted information is released.

The other hand, on the left, is resting on the form, with fingers spread out. The image is slightly angled.]
