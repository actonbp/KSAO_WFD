ACCESS TO PROTECTED
HEALTH INFORMATION

There are several state and federal laws that dictate how information in the client’s record must be protected and
how it can be shared. This information is often referred to as protected health information or PHI. Substance use,
mental health and medical information is generally subject to the provisions of the Health Insurance Portability
and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Substance use information has additional regulations found in Title 42 Code of
Federal Regulations (42 CFR), Part 2: “Confidentiality of Alcohol and Drug Abuse Patient Records.” It is important
for SUD counselors to be familiar with these confidentiality guidelines to properly protect and disclose client’s
information.

The Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), including
amendments in the Health Information
Technology for Economic and Clinical Health
(HITECH) Act

» Safeguards the privacy and confidentiality of electronically
transmitted client information from health care providers, health
plans, and health care clearinghouses.
» Protects the health insurance coverage of workers and their
families when there is a change in or disruption of employment.
» Simplifies the administration of health insurance.
» Combats waste in health care delivery.

HIPAA Consent Requirements

» Prohibits a healthcare organization from using or disclosing
protected health information unless authorized by patients,
except where this prohibition would result in unnecessary
interference with access to quality health care or with certain
other important public benefits. They may also release
information without consent to other involved healthcare
providers and obtain payments. Mental health therapy notes are
excluded from this disclosure and still require written consent.
Disclosure may only include the minimum amount of information
necessary to fulfill the task.

Federal Confidentiality Regulation of Alcohol and
Drug Abuse Records (42 CFR Part 2)

» Protects information about any person who has been given a
substance use diagnosis, has applied for substance use services,
or been referred to or received substance use treatment from a
program that receives federal assistance such as Medicare or
Medicaid funds.

42 CFR Part 2 Consent Requirements

» Specific consent is necessary for disclosure of information
contained in a client record maintained in any federally assisted
substance use program. This includes any program that provides
substance use services and receives federal assistance such as
Medicare or Medicaid funds.
» Allows a single consent for all future uses and disclosures for
treatment, payment, and health care operations.
» No client consent is necessary for a medical emergency, reports
of alleged abuse or crimes, and court orders. Consent is also not
necessary for public health authorities, auditors, research, and
communicating with business associates.
» Restricts the use of records and testimony in civil, criminal,
administrative, and legislative proceedings against patients,
absent patient consent or a court order.
