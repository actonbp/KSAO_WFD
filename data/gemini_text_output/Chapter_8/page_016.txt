352 IC&RC Alcohol and Drug Counselor (ADC) Certification Examination Study Guide

SUD counselors must know and comply with the specific requirements (from regulators, funders or procedures internal to the organization) for progress note formats and content, and timeframes for documentation of specific service types (e.g. residential services, outpatient services, medication-assisted treatments, individual or group sessions, etc.).

**Discharge Summary and Plan**

Many terms are used to describe the period after primary treatment services – aftercare, continuing care, or discharge. Organizations vary in the terms used; however, the same types of information and plans are usually interchangeable. As seen in a previous chapter in this study guide, recovery planning should be a component of the primary treatment phase and the recovery plan should be continually updated, including at the time of discharge. The recovery plan may be a separate document or one-in-the-same as the discharge plan.

The purpose of the discharge plan is to summarize the services delivered, the progress towards meeting goals and objectives, and any recommendations post discharge, including continuing care and recovery supports. Discharge, despite taking place at the end of a treatment program, should be a core consideration from the very beginning of the course of services. Early, effective planning facilitates the transition from primary treatment to other services and support is critical for long-term recovery.

Discharge summaries are often used to share pertinent information when clients are discharged from one program and referred to another to ensure continuity of care. It is important to **document treatment, continuing care, and recovery plans that are consistent with best practices.**

**ELEMENTS OF A DISCHARGE PLAN**

While formats will vary among organizations, discharge plans are more complete when they include all of the following:
» Presenting problems/issues and reason for services/reason for discharge
» Treatment goals/methods/outcomes
» Statement of client’s well-being at time of discharge
» Referral sources and ancillary services to address issues affecting stability (e.g., medical, mental health, vocational training, employment, housing, finances, etc.)
» Recovery-specific issues (triggers, relapse prevention, mutual aid groups, social integration, supportive relationships, etc.)
» Signature, date, and SUD counselor credentials

Information describing the reasons for discharge is also included. Such reasons may be treatment completion, leaving against medical advice (AMA), or treatment incomplete. A brief description of the clients’ status at discharge and prognosis for the future should also be included. Recommendations for post discharge activities or services could include participation in continuing care groups, mutual aid meetings, medications at discharge, and referral to other services or practitioners. It can also be noted what the client should do in the event of a relapse or crisis (return for services, contact crisis line, etc.).

This plan is developed with a client to identify recommended activities, support groups, referrals, and any other necessary follow-up activities that will support and enhance client progress following discharge or case closure. Enlisting the input from the client as to what will best assist them and involving significant others (when possible) is an important part of this process.
