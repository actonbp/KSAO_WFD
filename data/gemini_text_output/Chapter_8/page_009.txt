CHAPTER 8: Documentation 345

**TYPES OF DOCUMENTATION**

Documentation requirements vary based on the intensity and complexity of services delivered. While the guidelines for documentation may differ, most of the information identified below is fairly consistent across diverse organizations and services and from state to state. Agency-specific required information should be part of the SUD counselor’s orientation to job specific duties and responsibilities. Several areas of documentation have been addressed in earlier chapters in this study guide; however, these areas will also be summarized in this chapter for completeness.

Documentation typically occurs in the following areas:

**1. Client Administrative Information:**
    > **Personal information:** client information, including name, age, contact details, and emergency contacts
    > **Financial:** eligibility, ability to pay
    > **Informed consent for services:** forms for releases of information, consent for services, consent for tests (drug test, HIV/AIDs, etc.), signed and dated by client and witness
