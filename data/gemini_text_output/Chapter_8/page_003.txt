CHAPTER 8: Documentation 339

**The Client/Clinical Record**

SUD counselors are required to maintain a record for each client who receives services. The clinical record is a log of the client’s needs and preferences, interventions, and a variety of plans. Documentation provides a means of identifying, classifying, and evaluating the client’s needs by demonstrating that the services being delivered are both effective and efficient. The clinical record also verifies that the client has consented to services and been informed of their rights. It organizes notifications, consents, and releases of information appropriate to the client’s current situation.

The clinical record is the most important tool in assuring continuity of care throughout service delivery. While the multiple demands on the time and energy of SUD counselors cannot be denied, developing strong case documentation skills can contribute to and amplify service delivery and greatly improve the client’s overall experience.

Clients receiving SUD treatment services may have several providers from whom they are receiving services. This group of providers may work in the same organization or different organizations. Documentation is used to assist providers in identifying current problem areas and needs to best serve the client. The clinical record contains information such as observations, assessments, interventions, and supports that will assist providers in guiding the client towards achieving identified goals. The clinical record is also used to document current needs and future plans to support and sustain recovery.

Documentation from the SUD counselor provides supporting evidence for necessity and appropriateness of services. The clinical record tracks when the client is receiving appropriate services to fulfill the goals on the treatment plan. It also serves legal and administrative purposes. The clinical record, for example, is used to identify who delivered which services, and support billing for clinical services. Third party payers, such as Medicare and Medicaid, may have specific standards for what information must be included in the client record to qualify for reimbursement of services.

**Why Document?**

Documentation serves several important purposes.¹

» The clinical record is a **clinical tool** that chronologically details the condition of the client receiving services, why the services were needed, the services provided, who delivered the services, the client response to the services and the outcomes achieved because of the services. As such, it provides both a guide and a means of evaluating whether the services are achieving the desired outcomes.

» The clinical record ensures **continuity of care** for the client, regardless of counselor availability, changes in counselor or service provider, or subsequent readmission for services. This recording of essential elements of care ensures that pertinent information is available to the receiving counselor or program. This recording of essential elements of care helps ensure that pertinent information is available and provides the foundation of good service delivery for collaboration.

» The clinical record assists with organizational **risk management issues** to protect and defend against malpractice lawsuits and professional discipline. Documentation that facilitates risk management relates to: informed consent; justifications of professional decision-making; supervision or consultation; and, to substantiate the services, referrals provided, and the results.

» The clinical record is a **legal document** that records both counselor and client input and what did or did not take place within the delivery of services. In certain circumstances, portions or all of the clinical record may be requested by the courts if the client is legally involved, or in cases where the client brings legal proceedings against an SUD counselor or program.

» The clinical record demonstrates **accountability** by recording information that is used for billing purposes,
