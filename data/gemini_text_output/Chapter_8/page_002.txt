338 IC&RC Alcohol and Drug Counselor (ADC) Certification Examination Study Guide

**INTRODUCTION**

Documentation in the clinical record is an integral part of the delivery of substance use disorder (SUD) treatment services. In this age of increasing emphasis on both quality of service and accountability, documentation provides a means of organizing and evaluating clinical work by demonstrating that the services being delivered are both effective and efficient.

The clinical record is also used as a tool for supervision when the supervisor is unable to personally observe services as they are being delivered. As SUD counselors record their observations and actions, they are providing evidence of their competence in providing appropriate client care.

This chapter focuses on the role of documentation, the different types of documentation, applicable standards, and the skills that facilitate good documentation.
