Each binder has a circular label or finger hole on its spine. The binders appear to contain numerous papers. The image is in grayscale or has a desaturated look, emphasizing the theme of record-keeping and documentation.]

CHAPTER 8: Documentation 343

SUD counselors must also be aware of state reporting laws and agency policies. They are generally considered
**mandated reporters** for suspected abuse and neglect. The SUD counselor should document the evidence that
led to the suspected abuse or neglect and who the information was reported to such as the Abuse Hotline or the
appropriate staff member per agency policy.

It is important to document in the clinical record any information released and who received the information.
Any requests that occur outside of the scope of care coordination without a release of information may need to be
reported to a supervisor. Occasionally a subpoena and/or court order for a client's records may be received and, if
so, the SUD counselor should immediately inform the supervisor who may seek legal counsel as needed.

**Records Retention and Storage**

The client record is the physical property of the agency in which the services have been delivered. All states have
laws that regulate the retention of client records. Since the record is a legal document, it is important to have
established policies regarding record retention. Medical records are generally retained for a period of seven years,
but in the case of minors it may be longer under certain circumstances. SUD counselors should know the laws
regarding the retention of client records in their state. It is important to remember that all client records must
be disposed of in compliance with HIPAA and, for clients with substance use conditions receiving services in a
federal program, disposal must also comply with 42 CFR Part 2.

Client records in hard copies must be securely stored in locked file cabinets when not in use, with protection
against unauthorized access. All records and identifying information must be kept out of sight of unauthorized
personnel. This includes client lists and rosters, attendance records, appointment schedules, and information on
computers.

Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) also have established regulations
governing record retention and storage. As these digital records contain comprehensive and real-time
information about a client and can be shared across different authorized health care settings, they are highly
regulated. Federal laws like HIPAA also safeguard data regardless of whether the information is being stored on-
premises or in the cloud. More information on storage of EHRs can be found later in this chapter.
