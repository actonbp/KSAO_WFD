DOCUMENTATION SKILLS

Good documentation skills improve the quality of the clinical record and save the SUD counselor time and
energy. While experience is essential to developing these skills, there are some guidelines that can aid the SUD
counselor in this process. The recommendations outlined below are generally considered to be part of good
documentation.

1. **Write knowing others will read your documentation.** Today there are many situations where some or
   all of the client's record may be read by others, such as the client, the court, or an insurance company.
   Thinking of this as documentation is made will help maintain focus.

2. **Develop good habits:** Allocate specific times for documentation and stick to a routine. This can help
   ensure that documentation is done promptly and is not overlooked.

3. **Be objective.** Make assessments based on facts and observations to help eliminate personal subjectivity.
   Be attentive and note what the client (and significant others) says and does.

4. **Describe in behavioral terms.** Clarify what is occurring for the reader and give a clear picture of what
   behaviors need to be changed or initiated. Recording that "Johnny did not talk in group" is more accurate
   than saying that "Johnny was resistant." In addition, a clear description of the desired behavior is best â€“
   "Plan is to use encouragement and role play to increase Johnny's self-disclosure in group."

5. **Avoid jargon.** Technical terms, short-hand, or industry-specific language can be confusing or completely
   unfamiliar to other professionals who don't use the same short-hand or jargon. Using clear language
   ensures that the counselor's documentation is understood. This is especially true for documents that may
   need to go to external sources in the future.

6. **Be concise.** While it is important to be accurate, simply recording everything that was said and done
   in a session is unnecessary and overly time consuming. Learn to minimize extraneous information and
   summarize the essential points clearly and succinctly.

7. **Be positive.** Sometimes counselors unwittingly use language and terminology that appears to convey a
   negative view towards a client. Ensure that person-first language is the rule in documentation.

8. **Strive for consistency.** Be consistent in the structure of progress notes and other forms of documentation
   and standardize the display and order of note sections to improve your writing and facilitate the reading
   for other professionals. Use of templates for intake forms, progress notes, and treatment plans can help
   ensure consistency and completeness.

9. **Review and reflect:** Periodically review your documentation. Reflect on whether your notes are clear,
   concise, and useful for understanding the client's progress and your therapeutic interventions.

10. **Continuous improvement through feedback:** Seek feedback from peers, supervisors, or during
    professional development sessions. Understanding how others perceive your documentation can provide
    insights into areas for improvement.
