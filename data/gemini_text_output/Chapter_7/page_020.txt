ADVOCACY

Advocacy is a necessary competency for SUD counselors/case managers. Its foundation is rooted in ethical theory and principles. At its essence, advocacy may be described simply as “wanting, getting, and doing what is in the best interest of preoccupied the client and the family.”²⁶ Advocacy efforts cut across various case management domains to improve the quality of care and the client’s overall satisfaction with services.

Most advocacy actions taken by SUD counselors/case managers occur at the individual client level as they care for their clients and clients’ support systems. Advocacy often focuses on the client’s experience, relationship with the SUD counselor/case manager, and the resources and skills the client acquires. In addition, advocacy strategies may focus on organizational, service, community, or population levels; although, usually at a much lesser degree.

SUD counselors/case managers have a mandate to speak on behalf of the client and about what is in the client’s best interest. This type of advocacy occurs at every step of the case management process while: ²⁷, ²⁸
» Assessing clients’ needs and those of their support systems.
» Planning, facilitating, coordinating, managing, and integrating required services and support resources.
» Monitoring and evaluating the delivery of services and clients’ responses.
» Transitioning the clients from one level of care/setting or provider to another.
» Educating clients about and engaging them in: their treatment and other service plans; health and behavioral health care regimens; building self-care and self-management skills; and understanding how to navigate complex service systems.
» Monitoring and addressing delays in service provision to advance the progression of desired outcomes.
» Communicating with payers and other entities that cover benefits (e.g., insurance companies, managed care organizations) regarding the clients’ conditions, and service/treatment and transitional plans.
» Obtaining authorizations for services necessary for providing care to clients.
» Facilitating shared and informed decision-making concerning service options.
» Being transparent with the client and support system regarding service/care progression, quality and safety concerns, and cost of services.

The SUD counselor/case manager also may have to speak on behalf of the client in issues related to client rights. They may need to address client’s rights in any one of a number of situations, such as:
» A client being refused resources because of discrimination, whether discrimination is based on some intrinsic aspect of the client, such as gender or ethnicity, or on the nature of the client’s problems, such as addiction.
» A client being refused services despite meeting eligibility requirements.
» A client being discharged from services for reasons outside the rules or guidelines of that service.
» A client being refused services because they were previously accessed but not utilized.²⁹
