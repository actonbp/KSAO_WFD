**INTRODUCTION**

This chapter addresses the significance of case management skills and practices for SUD counselors. As discussed in previous chapters, substance abuse disorders often coexist with mental health issues, medical conditions, and social challenges. A comprehensive continuum of holistic services is needed for individuals with problematic substance use. The continuum must be designed to provide engagement and motivation, primary treatment services at the appropriate intensity and level, and support services. Treatment must be structured to ensure smooth transitions to the next level of care, avoid gaps in service, and respond rapidly to the threat of relapse. Case management can assist in all areas and is essential for integrating services and transitions across disciplines.

Case management is especially appropriate for individuals with SUDs as they often have special treatment needs, related to such issues as HIV infection or AIDS, MHDs, chronic and acute health problems, poverty, homelessness, and many other needs.

Practically, an SUD counselor should have a foundation of knowledge to successfully link clients to various types of treatment and community and recovery support resources, and the skills actively do so. Counselors should:¹
» Understand core principles of case management.
» Understand when a client would benefit from a referral to another healthcare provider.
» Know the landscape of available health and behavioral health, ancillary, and recovery services as well as mutual-help groups.
» Be familiar with the required protocols of providers, facilities, and services.
» Use effective collaboration skills to help ensure continuity of care and integrated services.
» Make warm handoffs when transferring clients to other providers or recovery communities.
» Maintain communication with referral and recovery resource partners.

SUD counselors usually have a percentage of their work devoted to case management activities. There is great variability in that percentage, however. It’s not uncommon for case management tasks to take up a substantial part of an SUD counselor’s time, especially in rural settings or settings where clients have complex needs and require coordination across multiple services. Conversely, in other settings, particularly where other team members may take on parts of the case management role, it might be less.

**In this chapter, the SUD counselor is often referred to as the “case manager” with the understanding that this role has great variability.**

A woman with dark, shoulder-length hair, wearing a plaid shirt, is seated at a table, smiling gently and looking towards a young blond-haired child. The child, also seated at the table, has a serious expression and is looking off to the side, with hands clasped on the table. Part of another person's hand is visible in the bottom right foreground, resting on the table. The image suggests a supportive interaction between a counselor or caregiver and a child.]
