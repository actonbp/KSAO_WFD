CHAPTER 7: Case Management and Collaboration 327

» Be empathetic and take time to understand the other’s point of view
» Describe their personal viewpoint as a perspective, not a fact, with the use of “I” statements
» Remain practical and realistic by basing communications and decisions on facts instead of emotions

**Negotiation** is about working together to find common ground to an existing challenge or developing
partnership. This often requires each side to be flexible and compromise to identify mutually agreeable
approaches and outcomes. Once common ground is identified, each party can explore the practicality and
feasibility of options based on each parties’ current resources, criteria, and objectives.

Negotiation follows along with shared decision-making. This process can be used to help assess the potential
benefits and risks of each option based on the purpose of the negotiation and the values of the parties involved.
Once negotiation begins, shared decision-making can be employed by exploring and comparing available
options, assessing how each option aligns with the values and priorities of the parties involved then negotiating
a plan of action that is later evaluated for effectiveness.²⁰

**Problem-solving** is another key skill used in negotiation. There are often different assumptions, expectations,
and points of view when approaching a task or a problem. SUD counselors/case managers engage routinely in
problem-solving when assisting clients and working with a multidisciplinary team.

Opening the channels of communication provides invaluable feedback about needs, values, and priorities
which will help guide the problem-solving and decision-making process. Decisions are often influenced by
available resources, including time. There are several different methods to evaluate options and reach a final
decision. There are several aspects to consider when determining the best course of action including not only
the consequences of the decision but whether the decision is fair, ethical, and legal. Once a decision is made and
implemented, it is important to monitor and evaluate the results. These outcomes may alter the way the plan is
being implemented or change the strategy altogether.
