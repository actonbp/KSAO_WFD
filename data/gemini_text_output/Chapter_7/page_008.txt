**SERVICE PLANNING**

Case managers guide the development of a personal plan to meet the client’s unique needs. This plan is often referred to as a **Case Management Service Plan** (or Care Plan). The service planning process begins with a review of the strengths and needs identified through case monitoring and through assessments. This also involves acquiring relevant information in a variety of areas, such as medical, functional, social, and emotional status. The case manager, in conjunction with the client, collaborates on the development of the service plan. The involvement of the client and their support network in every step of the process is crucial for the success of the service plan.

He is wearing a textured sweater. The image is slightly out of focus, with the foreground (desk and hands) sharper than the background. The lighting creates strong shadows, particularly on the person's face, obscuring some features. The setting appears to be an office or study, with papers and possibly a computer monitor visible in the background.]
