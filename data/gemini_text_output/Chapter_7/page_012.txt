of and response to services, and provider name and credentials are all some of the documentation elements that
are typically required by funders to authorize payment. Whether payment is authorized may determine if the
client is financially able to proceed with critical services.

**Resource Directories**

Most communities already have tools to assist SUD counselors/case managers in identifying resources, possible
provider linkages, and potential gaps in services. This information may come from a variety of sources including
the following.

» 2-1-1 is a number that can be called throughout the United States (and Puerto Rico) and connects callers
with a local call center. Operators assist callers with linkage to social services for crisis behavioral health
needs (i.e. suicidal ideation and domestic violence) as well as basic needs (i.e. housing expenses and food
banks). By simply dialing 211, those in need of assistance can be referred and sometimes connected to
appropriate agencies and community organizations.
» The United Way has information on community programs that can link residents with different needs.
The United Way has state and regional offices that assist with advocacy, community organization, and
disaster recovery services.
» Government websites are available for cities and counties. These sites often have important information
for residents on local government programs and how to contact government officials.
» Health and behavioral health professionals that work in hospitals are knowledgeable about the resources
available in the community.
» School counselors are often knowledgeable about community services for children and families.
» Faith-based organizations, including local churches, often have knowledge of community resources as
well as having their own assistance programs.
» The internet is always a good place to research local resources and find the most current information.

While directories and other service rosters provide a useful starting point in identifying potential resources and
service providers, additional work is required to determine which listings will prove fruitful. There are often
delays in publishing and updating such directories, so that they may be out of date even before dissemination.
It is critical that they be updated on a consistent, timely basis. Directories may not list all agencies or programs,
and more than one directory may be necessary because an agency’s focus can shift.

**Professional Networks**

Professional networks are often comprised of individuals who are primary points of contact for types of
information or services. Networking is a collaborative relationship that fulfills many functions including
mentoring for job skills, collaborating on interventions, and sharing knowledge. A professional network helps
individuals and organizations complete tasks by connecting with others to share information and resources.
Networks can assist SUD counselors/case managers with learning about new resources, receiving contact
information for programs and resources, and having individuals who can help navigate and problem-solve how
to access needed services.

The relationships between providers and organizations can also have a direct impact on a client’s care. SUD
counselors/case managers should cultivate relationships with professionals in different realms. Providers and
organizations should network with one another to keep abreast of availability and criteria for services. This
entails identifying the primary person who manages the organization’s referrals. These “gatekeepers” of
information can be identified in different medical and social service organizations such as hospitals, outpatient
service agencies, shelters, and schools. This helps with providing accurate information to the client as well as
having a contact person if there are questions or problems with the referral. Developing and cultivating these
relationships can assist with keeping up to date on available resources as well as linkage to services that are
necessary to continually meet the needs of clients.
