» The team focus is client-centered with common or intersecting, measurable goals.
» Clients and agencies have mutual responsibility and trust; interagency accountability and data sharing
exists.
» The backgrounds of team members bring different strengths and resources to service recipients and,
when possible, represent the demographics of the population they are serving.
» The network is open to new paradigms, approaches, use of technology on behalf of clients, and
individualization of client treatment plans and services.
» The team is aware of community resources and how to access them.
» The actions of the team follow current best practices, legal mandates, and risk management protocols
with integrated evaluation practices.
» Accountability is results- and progress-based, with interagency negotiation of shared outcomes.
» Team members are aware of limitations due to factors such as financial and time constraints.

One of the main components of teamwork is effective communication with all members including the client,
professionals, and community members. Effective communication creates stronger relationships, promotes trust
and team building, identifies clear expectations, increases productivity, and improves conflict resolution.¹⁶

**POTENTIAL CONFLICTS**

The potential for conflict exists whenever two agencies or service providers work together. Tension may be
present from the very onset of the collaboration. Tensions also can develop while delivering services. Interagency
collaboration may result in a client having two or more counselors, each of whom handles a specialized problem.
In such instances, SUD counselors/case managers may have competing priorities for the client which can create
a situation that becomes tense for all involved. Recognizing potential triggers for interagency conflict is a
necessary first step to dealing with it.

When problems do erupt, SUD counselors, case managers and other agency personnel can use both informal
and formal communication mechanisms to clarify issues, regain perspective, and refocus the interagency case
management process. The following list highlights some of the common sources of conflict that may arise.
» Unrealistic expectations about the services and outcomes that case management linkages can produce
» Unrealistic expectations of other agencies
» Disagreements over resources
» Conflicting loyalty between agency and consortium or partnership
» Final decision-making and other authority over the management of a case
» Differences in values, goals, and definitions of the problem, solutions, or roles (e.g., conflict could arise
when police officers working with social service personnel perceive that they are being asked to function
as "social workers" and vice versa)
» Dissatisfaction with case handling or other agency's case management performance
» Resentment over time spent on documentation, in meetings, or forging and maintaining agency
relationships rather than on providing client services
» Differences in counselor credentials and status among agencies
» Unclear problem resolution protocols for agency personnel¹⁷

The solution to interagency conflict is open, frank communication by personnel at all levels. Frequent meetings
and other activities that bring people together foster such communication. In the long run, the client's welfare is
a shared objective, and the difficulties that are likely to arise can be successfully resolved.

Specific communication skills foster more open conversations. It is important for to have good **negotiation**,
**problem-solving**, and **conflict resolution skills**. These skills can be used to help find common ground and come
to a mutual agreement. SUD counselors/case managers can help improve the outcome of the discussion by
engaging in the following actions.¹⁸, ¹⁹
» Be assertive and clearly communicate ideas and goals
» Apply a cooperative stance
» Be flexible and willing to compromise
