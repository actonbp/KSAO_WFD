7.  **Monitoring and follow-up activities.** Conduct activities and contacts that are necessary to ensure that the service plan is effectively implemented and adequately addresses the needs of the eligible individual. Follow-ups may include the client, family members, service providers, or other entities or individuals and conducted as frequently as necessary, and including at least one annual monitoring, to help determine whether the following conditions are met:
    a.  Services are being furnished in accordance with the client’s service plan.
    b.  Services in the care plan are adequate.
    c.  There are changes in the needs or status of the client. Monitoring and follow-up activities include making necessary adjustments in the service plan and service arrangements with providers.

**Case Management Knowledge and Skills**

Case management relies strongly on skills related to facilitating linkages to services; however, many other skills need to be employed. Case management requires knowledge of the industry and local community including the ability to relate to and adapt to the needs of the specific client. Here are some important tasks and skills for case managers.⁹

» Build and maintain an alliance with the client to combine resources and work toward common goals. The alliance will help generate an effective working relationship based on trust and rapport. Motivate the client to engage in and sustain healthy change.
» Use effective interpersonal and communication strategies to elicit information about client strengths, challenges, barriers, resources, and goals. Assist the client in identifying how to maximize current strengths and resources to overcome barriers and challenges and reach his or her goals.
» Be knowledgeable about local programs to provide appropriate referrals and link the client to suitable community resources.
» Work collaboratively and use the client’s, case manager’s, and community’s strengths and resources to help the client overcome barriers and challenges to achieve desired goals.
» Develop and maintain working relationships with community organizations to improve the overall service delivery to the client.
» Be knowledgeable about relevant laws and policies that impact the client. Embody and demonstrate professionalism.

**CASE MANAGER ROLES**

Case managers play a vital role in coordinating care and services for individuals. To ensure that their clients receive the appropriate services in a timely, efficient, and effective manner, case managers often take on several roles, including:

1.  **Facilitator:** Case managers act as facilitators by coordinating services and resources for their clients. This involves identifying the client’s needs, creating service plans, and ensuring that all service providers (e.g., healthcare professionals, social workers, counselors) are aware of and working towards the client’s goals. They facilitate communication between all parties and ensure that services are delivered seamlessly.
2.  **Problem Solver:** Case managers are often confronted with complex situations where standard solutions may not be applicable. They need to think critically and creatively to resolve these challenges. This might involve identifying barriers to care, addressing social determinants of health, or finding resources when they are scarce.
3.  **Negotiator:** Case managers advocate for their clients’ needs and wishes with service providers, insurance companies, and other stakeholders. They negotiate services, treatments, and resources to ensure their clients’ needs are adequately met. This role requires a deep understanding of the system in which they operate, the resources available, and the needs and rights of their clients.
