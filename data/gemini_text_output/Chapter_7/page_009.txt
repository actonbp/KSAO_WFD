CHAPTER 7: Case Management and Collaboration 321

As noted earlier, the service plan is generally comprised of the following:
» Based on information gathered during the assessment, specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and
time-bound (SMART) goals are set. These goals should address both immediate needs and long-term
aspirations of the client.
» Specific objectives and actions are set to address the medical, social, educational, recovery, and other
services identified.
» It identifies a course of action to respond to the assessed needs of the client. Follow-up and monitoring
activities are set to ensure the active participation of the client and collaborating with the client, the
client's support network and others to continually assess progress (and make modifications when needed)
in meeting the goals.

There may be questions about the differences between a case management service plan and a SUD treatment
plan. Both plans are crucial components in the recovery and support process for individuals dealing with SUDs.
They generally serve different purposes and functions, although a comprehensive treatment plan may overlap
with the service plan.

» The **SUD Treatment Plan** is primarily focused on the direct treatment of the substance use disorder. It
includes a comprehensive approach to address the medical, psychological, and social aspects of addiction.
It typically includes assessments, therapeutic interventions (individual, group, and possibly family),
medical treatment, and support for psychological health and recovery.
» The **Case Management Service Plan** is broader. It goes beyond the treatment components to include
coordination of various services and resources to support the individual's recovery journey: assistance
with housing, employment, education, legal issues, and accessing community resources. The main goal
is to ensure that individuals have the support and resources they need to not only recover from substance
use but also to reintegrate into society and improve their overall quality of life.

**COLLABORATION**

**Collaboration** occurs when several community organizations, agencies, and individuals make a commitment
to work together and contribute resources to achieve a common, long-term goal. Collaboration is the most
intense type of working relationship. Building and sustaining an effective collaboration requires much more
than a decision to merely work together. Effective collaborations promote team building, a sense of ownership,
enthusiasm, and an environment that maximizes the chance of collaborative partnerships succeeding. The
components of an effective collaboration are as follows:
» Stakeholders with a vested interest in the collaboration
» Trusting relationships among the partners
» A shared vision and common goals for the collaboration
» Expertise
» Teamwork strategies
» Open communication
» Motivated partners
» Means to implement and sustain the collaborative effort
» An action plan

Successful collaborations provide its partners with a vehicle to increase and integrate services for the
persons they serve. By sharing information, pooling resources, and working together to achieve shared goals,
collaborations can increase access to services, create greater efficiencies in service delivery systems and
coordination of care, as well as prevent individual partners from having to re-invent the wheel and duplicating
services.
