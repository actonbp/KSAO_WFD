CHAPTER 7: Case Management and Collaboration 323

LINKING PROFESSIONALS AND RESOURCES

Linkage to services is fundamental to case management. For any case management plan to be successful, an SUD
counselor/case manager must take a hard, objective look at community resources. What form do they take? What
are the barriers to access? Who makes the decisions about how they are used, how are these decisions made, and
how can they be obtained? If housing is a major client concern, for example, a community assessment should
determine if housing assistance is available and how case management efforts might help clients attain it.

Similarly, a client’s legal status can affect both the number and kinds of services needed (e.g., client involvement
in the criminal justice system or with child protective services agencies). Thus, depending on the legal needs
of its clients, a case management program will likely need to identify and forge relationships with such service
providers as battered women’s shelters, public assistance programs, legal aid, churches, 12–Step groups, and
other relevant organizations.

SUD counselors/case managers must be aware of the services available in the community, who those services
are appropriate for, and how to access them. This requires a current and working knowledge of the services and
resources available at the local, state, and national levels as well as those obtainable online.

Funding Sources

Funding sources can impact who can access services and, in some cases, eligibility criteria. While SUD
counselors or case managers are not typically involved in determining the kind of funding that is used to
finance a program or service, it is important to be aware of the funding source when reviewing client needs and
resources. One of the largest distinctions in funding is whether the program operates on public or private funds.

Public funding is distributed by a branch of local, state, or federal
government that typically has legislation outlining how the funds can be
distributed and used. Public funds can be made available to individuals
or organizations based on specified criteria and may be in the form of
an established government program. Government programs, such as
Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP, have standardized requirements to provide
assistance to large groups of people on a continued basis. A government
agency may also use a purchase of service to contract with a non-
government agency for services.

Private funding is considered any form of financing not stemming from
government funds. Private funding may originate from a commercial
insurance plan, organizational grants, or a contract for service. Programs
receiving private funding are still monitored and regulated, however,
since it is not tied to legislation private funding does not tend to have the
same strict parameters as public funding.

Public or private programs may use a sliding fee scale to assist individuals in accessing services. Sliding fee
scales are income based and provide a lower fee for service for someone with a lower income than someone with
a higher income. Some clients will pay full price for services while another client may pay only a fraction of the
cost or, in some cases, not be charged at all.

There may also be specific guidelines for service eligibility and delivery. The funding source of the program
or the client may determine how services are authorized, delivered, and documented. For example, a
preauthorization may be required for certain services when the client has commercial insurance or benefits
through the Veteran’s Administration. Many funders, including most private and public insurances, also require
that certain elements be present in documentation for reimbursement. Medical necessity for services, modality

legislation at the state or federal level
and focuses on delivering services
to groups based on identified and
justifiable needs.¹¹

**Private funding** may address
emerging needs and can be more
flexible and informal since it is not
tied to legislation with government
requirements.
