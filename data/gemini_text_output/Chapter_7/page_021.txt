CHAPTER 7: Case Management and Collaboration 333

**Self-Advocacy**

SUD counselors/case managers also work with their clients to grow and
support personal accountability in their lives. This involves teaching
clients how to advocate for themselves as much as possible and to provide
immediate assistance as needed, along with education so clients can
learn incremental skills that increase independence. This is known as
**self-advocacy** – the ability to speak up for oneself about the things that
are important. To self-advocate, clients must understand their needs and
strengths, learn how to get information, know about their rights, be able
to make decisions about important issues affecting them, and have the
courage to reach out to others for support and help when its needed.

To effectively achieve this, the SUD counselor/case manager must involve
the client in the advocacy process. This reinforces individual choice and
self-determination which are integral rights to upholding an individual’s
dignity. SUD counselors can empower clients by providing knowledge,
resources, and skills for self-advocacy.

The SUD counselor/case manager needs to seize opportunities to teach
skills that are needed for effective self-advocacy, such as problem-
solving, decision-making, and goal setting. SUD counselors/case
managers can assist clients in these areas by modeling respectful
interactions, informing clients of their rights, and encouraging the client
to voice needs, thoughts, and emotions. Other skills that benefit advocacy
efforts – such as active listening, stress management, emotion regulation, and conflict resolution skills – can be
taught. ³²

Involving clients in program planning and evaluation is another way to enable clients to get their voices
heard. This necessitates: 1) having formal avenues in which clients can participate in organizational decision-
making and feedback; 2) using established processes for client participation; and 3) ensuring their opinions are
respected and acted on by decision-makers. Some clients with behavioral health conditions require skill building
before they can meaningfully participate in these types of activities; therefore, client education should include
assertiveness training, successful strategies for working in groups, and communicating orally and in writing.

**Self-determination**³⁰, ³¹ identifies
the amount of independent choice
an individual has over their own life
by engaging in problem-solving,
goal setting, decision-making, and
self-advocacy based on their needs,
skills, beliefs, and social context.
Self-determination can also improve
safety while reducing the need for
involuntary examinations.

**Self-advocacy** is the act
of assertively identifying,
communicating, and pursuing one's
own preferences and goals.

**SUMMARY**

The integration of case management skills and practices in SUD treatment is indispensable. It brings a
structured, holistic, and client-centered approach to treatment, addressing the multifaceted nature of a client’s
conditions and needs. Through comprehensive assessment, multi-service collaboration and integration, and
continuous client engagement, case management enhances treatment efficacy, and promotes sustained recovery.
As such, developing and refining these skills is a priority for SUD counselors/case managers, ensuring that they
are well-equipped to guide their clients through the complex process of recovery.
