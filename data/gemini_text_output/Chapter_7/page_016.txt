**EFFECTIVE REFERRAL PROCESS**

Adopting a holistic view of clients is especially important for the case manager in making referrals to other providers or agencies. Case managers must coordinate services and broker appropriate and effective referrals. An effective referral includes connecting the client in a timely manner to appropriate services that the client agrees to and are accessible.

The case management service plan is the roadmap for referrals needed in each case. The case manager's knowledge of available services and understanding the criteria for those services is essential. Providing a referral to a client who is not eligible to receive the recommended services can make the client feel discouraged and prevent an appropriate referral from taking place. Therefore, it is very important for an applicable referral to be made in the most effective way.

A **formal referral** is provided when seeking an appointment with a professional such as a physician or an occupational therapist. Formal referrals allow the case manager to advocate for the client and are based on specific needs that are currently identified for the client. Some referrals will be **informal** and involve the case manager providing the client with information on community programs and services that the client can access on their own. These programs often do not require an appointment and the client can walk in during operating hours. Informal referrals promote client empowerment and networking.²¹
