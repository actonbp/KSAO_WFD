CHAPTER 7: Case Management and Collaboration 329

**Informal referrals** are also used for “natural” support services that are accessed by the client without the
brokering of the case manager. These can entail referrals or recommendations to community mutual support
groups, natural supports such as religious or spiritual organizations, or specific community programs for
socialization.

When providing referrals, it is important to keep in mind client rights as well as your own professional code
of ethics. These often identify factors such as obtaining informed consent for services and allowing the client
to engage in self-determination. Remember...**informed consent** involves explaining to the client the potential
benefits, risks, and alternatives of the proposed intervention before the client participates. Self-determination
includes discussing with the client preferences for a provider and what kind of service they want to engage in.
Some clients, for example, may have a preference regarding the gender of the provider and whether family is
involved in treatment.

**Case conferencing** is another referral mechanism. This is when a multidisciplinary group of service providers
working with a client come together to: 1. discuss the client’s case; 2. inform the development of the client’s
service plan, including identifying a range of services and support needed and where services can be accessed,
and 3. facilitate referrals for services. An example of this is when a case manager convenes a meeting involving
a child’s special education teacher, school nurse, and mother’s case manager to share perceived needs and
resources available to the child and the mother. During the case conferencing meeting, participants share ideas
for addressing needs and maximizing strengths within the child’s and parent’s case plan, and any specific
services that they themselves or their organizations can provide or that are available through other service
providers to help achieve the plan.

Case managers must also be aware of potential barriers that the client may encounter. This can include issues
such as financial concerns, transportation limitations, childcare obligations, or employment responsibilities.
These issues may help determine which referrals are made. For example, a client without reliable transportation
who lives near a bus line may need to receive all services from providers who are on the same bus line while
coordinating appointments with the bus route. Clients may also only be available certain hours due to other
obligations and responsibilities including employment and childcare.

**Safeguard protected health information.** The client should maintain control over their information. Best
practice, and many laws, indicates that the client is not only informed of how the information is maintained and
shared, but integrally involved in the decision-making process of who receives what information. A release of
information is typically obtained before the case manager will share the client’s information. The release may
be verbal but is typically written to strengthen documentation and ensure the client understands the parameters
of the disclosure. In addition, confidentiality requirements vary based on whether the services are for physical
health, mental health, or substance use.

Laws such as HIPAA and 42 CFR Part 2 protect the client’s information; however, there are also provisions that
allow for a case manager to share some client information without consent. Case managers most commonly
encounter this exception in the practice of discharge planning. When a client is unable or unwilling to provide
consent for a full referral, the case manager can share a minimal amount of information to complete a referral
for continuity of care. While this is not best practice and only minimal information can be shared, clients should
be made aware of when and why this referral was made. In addition to federal mandates, some states and payors
also have laws that address client policies and procedures including those that address how referrals must occur
when a client is discharged from an inpatient stay in a hospital.
