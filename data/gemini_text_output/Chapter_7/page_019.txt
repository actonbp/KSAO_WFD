CHAPTER 7: Case Management and Collaboration 331

**Monitoring and Evaluation**

SUD counselors/case managers
are responsible for monitoring
the client’s progress. Monitoring
activities can occur through face-
to-face in person or virtual visits,
phone calls, email correspondence,
and a review of documents in the
client’s record. It is important
to consider what data is being
collected. A home visit, for
example, may provide the most
information as the SUD counselor/
case manager can see, hear, and
smell the environment the client is
living in.

Monitoring involves identifying any
changes in the client’s condition,
needs, and preferences. This
includes analyzing the client’s
engagement and access to services,
progress towards existing goals,
and barriers to meeting their goals.
In addition to the identified goals, the SUD counselor/case manager should continue to monitor the client’s
rights, safety, and satisfaction with services.²⁴

Below it are five checkboxes, each with a corresponding rating. From top to bottom, the ratings are: "Outstanding", "Very Good", "Satisfactory", "Marginal", and "Unsatisfactory". A black checkmark is in the box next to "Outstanding". A silver pen with a black grip is resting on the paper, its tip pointing towards the lower options. The background is white paper.]

In some cases, new goals or interventions may need to be developed to assist with changing needs, lack of
progress, or to continue to enhance the client’s overall wellbeing. Monitoring areas such as compliance with
finances, medications and health care appointments, housing and food security, operating utilities, hygiene,
education, and employment can assist with this process.²⁵ The SUD counselor/case manager should periodically
meet with the client as well as review existing documentation, and speak with other providers and members
of the client’s personal support system when permitted in order to get different perspectives on the client’s
progress and needs.

Another aspect of regular monitoring relates to the referral system to determine if it is functioning as intended.
The purpose of referral monitoring is to provide routine information regarding the flow of clients through a
network of providers. Referral monitoring also allows SUD counselors/case managers to determine whether
services are integrated successfully, whether clients are receiving comprehensive care, and whether clients can
access a wide range of services. A good monitoring system will allow decision makers to track data such as:
»   the number and how often referrals are being provided to the different facilities and services
»   the total number of referrals made
»   the number or percent of referral services completed
»   whether adequate follow-up is provided after the referral is made
»   the number or percent of clients who reported their needs were met
»   the number or percent of clients who report satisfaction with the referral process
