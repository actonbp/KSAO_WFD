CHAPTER 7: Case Management and Collaboration 317

**Principles and Functions of Case Management**

Case management is a set of social service functions that helps clients access the resources they need to recover from a behavioral health condition. The functions that comprise case management—**assessment, planning, linkage, monitoring, and advocacy**—must always be adapted to fit the particular needs of a treatment or agency setting. This may not be a linear process as there may be some back and forth and returning to certain points.

**PRINCIPLES**

Case managers should comply with a core set of principles to guide their behavior and interaction with clients and their families. This provides a foundation of care and responsibility for decisions and actions taken. There are several principles of effective case management that focus on the following values and practices.⁸

» Case management offers the client a single point of contact with the health and social services system.
» Case management is client-centered. Each client’s right to self-determination is emphasized. The case manager is familiar with the client’s experiences, understands the client’s hierarchy of needs and concerns, and uses this knowledge to help the client access the chosen services.
» Case management focuses on how existing strengths can be used and additional strengths can be developed to assist clients in achieving their healthiest state and optimal functioning.
» Case management addresses current needs while also anticipating future needs. The case manager assists the client with identifying problematic aspects of their life, engaging in problem-solving processes, and in making rational decisions on a course of action.
» Case management is expected to be flexible to adapt to the fluctuating needs of the client. This includes making modifications to plans and services based on the client’s current symptoms and challenges.
» Case managers need to be knowledgeable and nonjudgmental about the client’s culture. This enables them to effectively connect with the client and service providers in the client’s community. Case managers also serve as role models in the use of non-stigmatizing language, and demonstrating culturally responsive attitudes, and actions for other service providers.
» Case managers help the client access and integrate formal and informal care services, overcome barriers to services, and transition between services. They use a community-based approach by assisting the client with accessing and navigating provider services, programs, and other community resources.
» Case managers advocate for the client’s best interests. Advocacy can take many forms including advocating for a specific client’s needs with a single provider or advocating for systematic change through political and legislative action.
» Case managers DO NO HARM. This means ensuring that actions and interventions designed to support clients do not expose them to further harm. At each step of the case management process, care must be taken to ensure that no harm comes to clients as a result of case manager conduct, decisions made, or actions taken on behalf of the client.
