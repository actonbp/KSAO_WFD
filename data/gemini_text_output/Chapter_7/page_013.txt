One method that is used to connect within a professional network is using a Memorandum of Understanding. A Memorandum of Understanding, often referred to as an MOU, is a document that defines a formal agreement between two or more parties to collaborate on service delivery or share information. When organizations frequently coordinate care for multiple clients, it may be beneficial to develop an MOU which can provide guidance and outline a structure for how the partnership is expected to occur. MOUs often delineate a purpose or specific goals, roles and responsibilities of each partner, decision-making procedures, and the terms of the agreement.¹² SUD counselors should be knowledgeable about MOUs their organization have with other service provider organizations and how those MOUs impact their professional responsibilities.

**Multidisciplinary Teams**

SUD counselors/case managers should view their clients with the assumption that it is not feasible or effective to provide everything that clients need “under one roof.” A more fruitful approach is to collaborate with other agencies based on client needs and overlapping client caseloads. This approach requires collaboration with a diverse group of service providers to deliver services to a client. This **multidisciplinary team** is composed of members from different service areas (e.g., SUD treatment, vocational rehabilitation, mental health). This method of service can be structured through programs that provide multiple services in-house or through a connected network. In a connected referral network, members of the multidisciplinary team provide their services in different locations. In this case, a multidisciplinary team approach can be fostered by holding regularly scheduled case conferences. These multidisciplinary teams have been shown to improve treatment outcomes for clients.¹³

Multidisciplinary team members have a mutual interest in achieving positive outcomes for the client. The counselor/case manager can help achieve this end by attending to team process issues that build the working relationship and foster collaboration. Research has defined specific characteristics of an effective and efficient multidisciplinary team.¹⁴, ¹⁵

» Multiple agencies work as equal partners with each other and with the client; referring agencies make the initial contact to the referral source and keep abreast of client progress.
» Team members have identified roles and responsibilities, and are accessible, responsive, and proactive.
» Relationships among providers are collaborative and flexible in the assumption of multiple job tasks related to client needs.
