**PRIORITIZATION OF SERVICE NEEDS**

Once presenting issues have been defined, case managers need to estimate their severity. Establishing problem severity is a critical skill that determines how soon the case manager should deal with a client’s needs. Estimating problem severity by acquiring good initial baseline information helps in the evaluation of case management services. It also allows both clients and case managers to track goal attainment over time.¹⁰

The case manager must develop an understanding of the complexity of the client’s overall situation. Increased complexity could arise from the significant impact of one single factor in the client’s life or the totality of the client’s circumstances being greater than the individual factors. Client needs, resources, and barriers are all factors that need to be considered when identifying a strategy to assist the client in meeting his or her goals.

The assessment and management of **risk** is also the responsibility of all case managers. Some clients present complex profiles that have varying levels of risk to safety and well-being for themselves or to the public. Some may have:
» severe and enduring SUDs and/or MHDs
» co-occurring diagnoses (e.g., substance use and chronic health conditions)
» history of violence or self-harm
» unsettled living accommodations or homelessness

When a client engages in behavior that poses risk to their (or someone else’s) health, safety or well-being an assessment of risk should be completed. This is completed to: evaluate the risk of certain behaviors; document what is being done to educate or protect the individuals effected by the risky behavior and to inform an individual or their guardian (if applicable) of how the individual’s lifestyle might be limited if they continue to engage in the risky behavior or if a particular intervention is utilized. It may or may not lead to a decision to restrict the individual’s rights.

It is important to understand that risk in behavioral health case management may range from low to high or “serious or imminent.” The priority given to needs and services should be determined by the level of risk. Risk is dynamic and can be affected by circumstances that can change over the briefest of timeframes. Therefore, risk assessment needs to include a short-term perspective and frequent review.

Ultimately, the case manager must also determine whether the program or organization can adequately meet the client’s needs. This involves reviewing the information on micro and macro levels. There may be times when the case manager is unable to directly link clients with needed resources due to lack of funding for or availability of specialty services. The case manager can, however, identify the need for further evaluation, educating the client on the importance of following up with another provider or program, and assisting the client with scheduling an appointment.
