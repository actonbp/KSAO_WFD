The case management functions that assist eligible individuals obtain services include:

1.  **Comprehensive Assessment.** Conduct initial and periodic reassessment of individual needs, to determine the need for any medical, educational, social, or other services. These assessment activities include the following:
    a.  Taking a client history.
    b.  Identifying the needs of the individual and completing related documentation.
    c.  Gathering information from other sources, such as family members, medical providers, social workers, and educators (if necessary) to form a complete assessment of the eligible individual.

2.  **Development (and periodic revision) of a Case Management Service Plan.** Craft a plan based on the information collected through the assessment, that includes the following:
    a.  Specifies the goals and actions to address the medical, social, educational, and other services needed by the eligible individual.
    b.  Includes activities such as ensuring the active participation of the eligible individual and working with the individual (or the individualâ€™s authorized health care decision maker) and others to develop those goals.
    c.  Identifies a course of action to respond to the assessed needs of the eligible individual.

4.  **Referral.** Determine and arrange for needed services, including activities that help link the client with medical, social, and educational providers or other programs and services that can provide needed services to address identified needs and achieve goals specified in the care plans (e.g., treatment, recovery, discharge).

5.  **Client Advocacy.** Support client self-advocacy. Intervene with agencies or persons to help clients receive appropriate benefits or services. Clients may also request assistance with advocacy from their case manager even when they are able to advocate for themselves.

6.  **Crisis Intervention.** Provide short-term crisis intervention in an emergency situation to resolve the immediate problem before a long-term plan is developed or current plan is revised.

In the center, a woman with dark, shoulder-length hair, wearing a dark blazer over a lighter top, is seated and looking towards her left. To her left, a person (gender unclear, possibly a woman with short, dark, curly hair) is seen from the back and side, seemingly writing on a notepad on a table. To the right, a man with short dark hair, wearing a light-colored collared shirt, is seated and looking towards the central woman. The background includes a brick wall and what appears to be a window or doorway. The overall scene suggests a professional interaction, such as a counseling session or meeting.]
