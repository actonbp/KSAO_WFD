CHAPTER 4: Evidence-based Screening 197

» **Medications:** Prescription medications are a common source of false positives. For example, certain antidepressants, decongestants, and pain relievers can trigger false positives for amphetamines, opioids, and other substances.

» **Over-the-Counter (OTC) Products:** Some OTC products, such as cough suppressants or sleep aids, contain ingredients that might result in a false positive for substances like opioids or marijuana.

» **Technical Errors:** Mistakes in the handling, storage, or analysis of the sample can also lead to false positive results. This includes contamination of the sample, incorrect test administration, or misinterpretation of the results.¹⁰²

It is important to note that legitimate false positives are only an issue in the screening phase. Once LC-MS/MS (liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry) is used to analyze a specimen, confirmation (positive or negative) is made with precision.¹⁰³

**False negatives** can also occur. This happens when the urine drug concentration is below the threshold level set by the laboratory performing the test. Issues such as dilute urine, the duration of time between ingestion of the drug and time of testing, and the quantity of the drug ingested may affect the occurrence of false negatives.

The following table shows the current cut-off levels for specific drugs for the initial and confirmatory tests per federal law.¹⁰⁴ Results are reported as positive or negative based on the cut-off levels. Positive results indicate that the drug concentration in the blood is above the predetermined threshold; negative results are reported when the drug concentration is below the threshold.
