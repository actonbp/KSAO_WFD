**LEVELS OF CARE CRITERIA**

**American Society of Addiction Medicine - ASAM Criteria®115**

The **ASAM Criteria** is the most widely used and comprehensive set of standards for placement, continued service, and transfer between levels of care for people with SUDs and co-occurring conditions. The ASAM Criteria began as a collaboration with national and state organizations that was focused on developing one unified set of standards for determining patient admission, continued service, and transfer criteria. It was first published in 1991, then called the ASAM Patient Placement Criteria. The name was updated in 2013 with the third edition. The 4th edition was released in 2023.

*The ASAM Criteria* define standards for a complete system of care, including:

1. assessing patients’/clients’ needs across six dimensions, including factors critical to recovery such as withdrawal potential, medical needs, emotional and behavioral conditions, readiness to change, potential for relapse, and an individual’s living situation and support systems.

2. using research-based decision rules that interpret the multidimensional assessment and match patients/clients to the proper level and type of care.

3. placing each patient/client on a continuum of treatment services based upon individual needs.

4. establishing characteristic service standards for each level of care within that continuum.

5. setting proper staffing levels, assessment and treatment planning needs, therapeutic requirements, and ensuring proper support systems and documentation.

The ASAM criteria delineates a range of **specific levels of care**. The criteria are designed to help clinicians more effectively assess and meet the needs of clients with co-occurring mental and substance-related disorders. The criteria are applied across a continuum to determine an appropriate level of care.

» **Recovery Residence.** This level (new in the 4th edition) provides a structured living environment for individuals recovering from SUDs. They are designed to support individuals in their recovery by offering a stable and substance-free living situation alongside peer support and, in some cases, access to recovery and treatment services.

» **Level 1: Outpatient Services.** This level of care is designed for individuals who do not need 24-hour supervision and can manage most of their recovery with less frequent clinical interventions. It’s suitable for those with a stable living situation and a supportive social environment.

> **1.0: Long-term Remission Monitoring.** This level is designed to support individuals who have successfully completed more intensive SUD treatment programs and have maintained a period of remission. Individuals receive ongoing monitoring and occasional support to help sustain their recovery over the long term.

> **1.5: Outpatient Therapy.** This level involves regular therapy sessions, typically ranging from one to several times a week, based on need. This can include individual, group, and family sessions. The objective is to provide therapy and support while the individual continues to live at home and potentially maintain employment or education.

> **1.7: Medically Managed Outpatient.** This level of service provides more intensive medical, psychiatric, and other therapeutic interventions. It is suitable for individuals with conditions that require more frequent contact with medical professionals for monitoring and management but do not necessitate 24-hour care. This could include regular assessments, medication management, and treatment for co-occurring mental health conditions that can be managed in an outpatient setting.
