**Motivational Approaches/Promoting Change**

Everyone is unique in experiences, perception, skills,
readiness, and commitment. These factors influence
a client’s motivation to pursue change and engage in
activities that will promote change. While clients may
have similar experiences, challenges, and goals, it is
important to remember that the motivation behind the
goals, and the avenue to reach those goals, may look very
different.

Change has been described as a continuous process.
Change involves being motivated to do something
different and then engaging in modified behaviors over an
extended period of time. Behavioral health providers are
often equipped with valuable strategies and interventions
for helping people make changes and yet, the people they
serve do not always take advantage of these interventions.

**Motivational Interviewing (MI)**, a widely used and studied practice in health and behavioral health, is a style of
interaction to facilitate change. As the name implies, its primary purpose is to strengthen motivation for change
– the person’s own motivation. MI provides a way to work with individuals to increase motivation to engage in
treatment services and enhance overall motivation for behavior change. MI is not about fixing people. It doesn’t
come from a deficit view that people are lacking something that needs to be instilled.
» MI rests on a strength-based framework that recognizes the value of each human being and their
freedom to choose what they will do and how they will be.
» MI is a person-centered approach that seeks to enhance an individual’s motivation to change by
exploring and resolving ambivalence. It has been framed as a “guiding” style of communication as
compared to a more “directive” style.
» This style or a “way of being” with clients uses a specific set of skills that are used to convey empathy,
enhance motivation, and encourage clients to consider and plan change.¹⁵

MI views individuals as the experts on their lives and the behavioral health professional collaborates with them
to look at thoughts and ways of addressing client-identified concerns.

There are many benefits to using MI:

1. The aspects, principles, and values of MI are like those that guide and are embraced by a wide range of
helping professionals.

2. MI has a rich body of evidence that supports its use with populations at risk and people seeking SUD and
mental health disorder (MHD) treatment.

3. MI has been found to be effective in clients from diverse backgrounds and settings and seems to fit well
with concepts of cultural competency.¹⁶

4. MI is a flexible approach as a stand-alone or in combination with other interventions.¹⁷

MI is, first and foremost, a **conversation about change**. It can be brief or prolonged, but it is always a
collaborative conversation. Being motivated is incomplete without commitment. As part of strengths-based,
person-centered screening, assessment and counseling, SUD counselors can use a strategy from MI called
**decisional balancing** to better understand what clients with active substance use think they are getting out
of such use and to help them find reasons to address it. When clients observe that the costs of substance use
outweigh the benefits, they may be motivated to reduce or stop it. Decisional balancing can be used for any type
of decision.
