It is important to assess the way we use language and how the use of language reinforces negative biases or promotes empowerment and strengths. Here are some tips for avoiding stigmatizing language.

» Perform a “language audit” of existing organizational materials for language that may be stigmatizing, then replace with more inclusive language.

» Take a personal inventory of the terms you may use; change the use of slang that is mocking or derogatory, such as disturbed, mental patient, insane, crackhead, felon, strung-out, in denial, etc.

» Be thoughtful in everyday conversations and set an example in using person-centered terminology with co-workers, persons served, and the public.

» Avoid the use of common terms, used in everyday language, that have the potential for perpetuating stigma in society, such as “My supervisor went nuts when I didn’t finish an assignment on time.”⁴¹
