176 IC&RC Alcohol and Drug Counselor (ADC) Certification Examination Study Guide

» The client or the client's substitute decision-maker needs to fully understand what will happen during
the course of care, the risks and benefits of participating in or refusing services, the possible outcomes,
and alternative options.

» The client must realize that they have the right and the power to consent to – and more importantly,
to refuse to consent to – any service offered. Unless there is a court order, clients who are receiving
involuntary behavioral health services still have a right to consent to or refuse treatment.

Beyond consents for specific services, HIPAA requires covered programs to follow specific rules when handling
protected health information. The use and disclosure of PHI requires certain types of consent including
nonverbal consent or written consent depending on how the information will be used. An **authorization** needs to
be obtained from the client; it is the consent of an individual providing explicit authorization to use or disclose
their personal information. Authorizations should have certain elements to be considered valid.

1. The information that is going to be disclosed should be defined and clear to the individual providing their
consent.

2. Each form should include a spot for the individual to print their name to that it is obvious who is
providing authorization.

3. Explicit information about who may use or disclose the PHI as a direct result of providing authorization.

4. A detail of each use or disclosure that will be a result of the authorization. An individual providing
authorization should understand any way that their information is planned to be used or disclosed.

5. A date of expiration where the authorization is no longer valid, and their information can no longer be
used or disclosed.

6. Finally, there should be an area where the individual providing their authorization can provide their
signature.

**Focus:PHI**

The Center of Excellence for
Protected Health Information (also
known as the CoE-PHI) is funded
by SAMHSA to assist people and
organizations to understand and
apply federal health privacy laws and
regulations – on the job, specific to
their task or role, and to help patients
and families know what their rights
are when seeking and receiving
treatment for Substance Use
Disorders and Mental Health.

With regards to behavioral health, consent is obtained from the client
for a variety of purposes. It is required to speak with someone involved
in the client's case, in most circumstances. Consent should always be
obtained in writing with the signature and date of the client or the
client's legal substitute decision maker. When someone with legal
authority to make decisions for the client, such as a parent or legal
guardian, then the decision maker can be spoken to as though they are
the client and are typically required to supply consent on the client's
behalf.

There are some emergency situations when minimal information can
be provided for safety or security or for coordination of care. Counselors
are also allowed to speak with other providers for coordination of care
without a consent; however, obtaining consent is still best practice. This
assists with trust and rapport while also allowing the counselor to share
more information than would be permitted in a non-consent referral.
More information about confidentiality and the law can be found in
Chapter 9.

confidentiality laws can be found on the **Focus: PHI** website. This site
