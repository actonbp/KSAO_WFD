language and consciously change it.

The ability to understand and use nonverbal communication, or body language, is a powerful tool that can help
counselors connect with clients in a positive way and reinforce mutual understanding and respect.⁵⁴ Maintaining
an attentive posture, making frequent eye contact, and appropriately using silence are also critical non-verbal
skills for counselors. When messages are confusing, however, both connection and trust in relationships are
damaged. For example, it is important that counselors ensure their non-verbal messages are congruent with
their verbal messages. In addition, it is important to be aware that different personal and cultural factors can
influence the way that nonverbal communication is interpreted. While most people in the western cultures find
eye contact to be respectful and engaging, some may feel challenged by engaging in direct eye contact.⁵⁵

3 **Empathy**: Empathic communication refers to the ability to understand and share the feelings of another.
It is a two-way process that involves not only recognizing and sharing emotions but also responding to
them in a supportive and non-judgmental manner. This skill helps to promote trust, reduce conflict, and
enhance social harmony.⁵⁶ Examples of empathic communication are:

» Using verbal affirmations to show that the speaker’s feelings are understood. Phrases like “It sounds like
you’re feeling…” can be helpful.

» Acknowledging and validating the other person’s perspectives, even if the counselor does not agree with
their perspective. Validation can be as simple as saying, “I can see why you would feel that way.”

4 **Questioning**. The counselor should use questions for clarification to understand clients, to motivate
them to pursue a specific topic, and to help clarify thoughts. The use of open-ended questions – those
that cannot be answered with a simple yes or no – can help the client to express feelings and convey
information. Asking one question at a time, rather than piling questions one on top of the other will help
avoid a feeling that the client is being interrogated. Avoiding use of the word “why” and other confrontational
questions is also important in establishing a positive relationship.

5 **Observing**. The counselor should consciously observe the client to see information that is conveyed non-
verbally. Things such as dress and appearance may be signals that reflect an individual’s state of mind,
body-image, self-concept, or cultural identification. You can also look for clues as to whether there may
be signs of negative effects on the body from drugs, alcohol, inadequate diet, or domestic violence. It is
important to observe gait, posture, gestures, facial expressions, and affect as well to get a complete picture of
the client.

The interviewer has several goals in the initial interview: (1) establishing trust, rapport, and effective
communication with the client; (2) facilitating the client’s understanding of the rationale, purposes, procedures
associated with the screening and assessment process; (3) exploring the client’s problems and expectations; and
(4) determining whether further assessment is needed. The first step in developing an effective relationship or
rapport with a client is to make them feel comfortable. Comfort can be communicated by the counselor’s own
comfort level and the ability to convey warmth and respect to the client. One way to convey respect is to support
a client’s skills and strengths. Through exploration and support, the counselor can also reassure the client they
are interested in them and desire to help them in concrete, active ways.
