**INTRODUCTION**

The philosophies of healthcare have evolved significantly over the years, shifting from an illness-oriented service to a more holistic and person-centered approach. This transition emphasizes understanding and catering to the individual's health needs, values, and preferences. The key aspects of these overlapping philosophies can be summarized as follows:

**Embracing Individuality:** Healthcare has increasingly recognized the uniqueness of individuals and is moving away from one-size-fits-all solutions. This requires a relational foundation that is based on trust, empathy, compassion and responsiveness to individual needs and values. Personalized treatment and care plans that respect individual preferences and life circumstances are the norm.

**Recovery-orientation:** As detailed in Chapter 1, there has been considerable advancement in the understanding of problematic substance use and recovery. Recovery is a highly personal journey toward wellness, satisfying relationships, engagement in community, and a sense of meaning and purpose. Practice standards for screening, assessment, treatment, and recovery support need to address a range of biological, psychological, and sociocultural considerations.

**Person-Centered Care:** Person-centered care is one of the key quality indicators in healthcare. Person-centered care has been an organizing principle for health and behavioral health systems as they move towards more integrated health care delivery. This approach prioritizes the client's own perspectives and tailors care to individual needs, values, and preferences.¹ It emphasizes the importance of understanding the client beyond their substance use and other potential conditions, ensuring that care is respectful and responsive.

**Strengths-Based Approach:** Current practices emphasize a strengths-based model, where the focus is on the individual's strengths, capabilities, and resources. This shift encourages empowerment and self-efficacy in managing health and wellness.

**Holistic Care:** Holistic care is integral to modern healthcare philosophies. It involves understanding and addressing the physical, mental, social, and spiritual well-being of individuals. Research indicates that health, happiness, and meaning can be cultivated most effectively by adopting a holistic framework.²

**Integration of Care:** As noted in Chapter 2, there's a growing emphasis on integrating various elements of care, ensuring coordination and continuity across different health care providers and settings.³

As such, effective screening and assessment for substance use disorders requires a person-centered and strengths-based approach that integrates comprehensive, evidence-based screening and assessment tools, awareness of co-occurring conditions, consideration of biopsychosocial factors, and use of a recovery-orientation.
