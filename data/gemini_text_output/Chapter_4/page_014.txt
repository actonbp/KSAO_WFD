Rapport
“Establish rapport” and “build rapport” are phrases familiar to the SUD counselor and other health care professionals. Establishing rapport is an expected outcome of first meetings with clients. Whether the counselor will see the client only for a brief screening or assessment interview or for an ongoing therapeutic relationship, building rapport and establishing a positive relationship is critical if the client is to successfully engage in and complete the treatment process.

Rapport refers to the bond of trust, mutual respect, and understanding that develops between a counselor and their client. It means a having sense of connection with the person. This connection is considered a foundational element of an effective therapeutic relationship, enabling clients to feel safe, valued, and open to sharing their thoughts and feelings. Rapport facilitates communication, enhances cooperation, and supports the entire course of care, leading to better outcomes.46

Developing rapport involves several key components and actions by the counselor. As noted earlier, it begins with creating a welcoming and non-judgmental environment that fosters open communication. Counselors demonstrate empathy, actively listen, and validate the client’s experiences and feelings. Building rapport also requires consistency, reliability, and the counselor’s genuine interest in the client’s well-being. The process includes understanding the client’s cultural, social, and personal background to tailor the approach in a manner that resonates with the client’s unique perspective.47

Establishing rapport is not a one-time task but an ongoing effort throughout the course of care. It involves continuous attention to the client’s needs, adaptive communication strategies, and the reinforcement of the alliance. The counselor’s ability to be present, authentic, and empathetic plays a critical role in deepening the rapport over time.
