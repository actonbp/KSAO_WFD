» Principle #1: People can recover, reclaim, and transform their lives.
» Principle #2: The focus is on an individual’s strengths, rather than deficits.
» Principle #3: The community is viewed as an oasis of resources.
» Principle #4: The client is the director of the helping process.
» Principle #5: The worker–client relationship is primary and essential.
» Principle #6: The primary setting for our work is in the community.

The strengths-based assessment is started during the engagement phase of the helping relationship and should be frequently updated as the counselor learns more about a person’s talents, skills, environmental strengths, interests, and aspirations. A collaborative, strengths-based, and person-centered assessment identifies clients’ current coping skills and abilities, family, social, and recovery supports. Counselors should view strengths broadly to include people’s values; interpersonal skills; talents; knowledge and resilience gained from previous efforts to overcome problematic substance use, stressful life events, or adversity (including trauma); spirituality and faith; personal hopes, dreams, and goals; family, friend, and community connections; cultural and family narratives of resilience; and general skills in daily living.

**Recovery Capital**

Successful recovery is dependent upon the presence of both internal assets (qualities, strengths, characteristics, and skills possessed by the person in recovery) and external assets (resources outside of the individual). Focusing on recovery capital shifts the emphasis from the pathology of an SUD to the quality of life that the individual can acquire in recovery.⁹

The concept of **recovery capital** reflects the belief that everyone has strengths and resilience and that building on them is central to the recovery process. Having greater recovery capital is associated with positive outcomes, such as SUD treatment completion, attendance at follow-up appointments, and meeting one’s recovery plan goals.¹⁰, ¹¹

SUD counselors need to understand the concept of recovery capital and incorporate it into their practice by working with clients to help them identify, access, and build their own recovery capital. Recovery capital is usually divided into four categories.

**Personal recovery capital** includes “physical recovery capital,” such as food, access to transportation, and safe housing as well as “human recovery capital,” such as values, knowledge, educational and job skills, problem-solving skills, internal motivation or commitment to recovery, and self-awareness.¹²

**Family/social recovery capital** includes intimate relationships; biological family; family of choice; friends; and relationships at school, work, faith-based institutions, and community organizations that support individuals’ recovery efforts.¹³

**Community recovery capital** includes attitudes, policies, and resources in clients’ communities that promote recovery from substance use–related problems through multiple pathways.

**Cultural recovery capital** includes the availability of traditional and other culturally based pathways of recovery that help support clients from that culture. Cultural recovery capital also includes the values and beliefs associated with a culture that support recovery.¹⁴

Assessing recovery capital is a vital part of the recovery process. Individuals should draw on and use the recovery capital available to them to support the recovery journey, but they often do not recognize the recovery capital they have or what is available to them. One important role of SUD counselors is to help the client to identify and use their recovery capital. By understanding the specific resources and supports a client has, counselors can tailor their approaches to leverage these strengths, fostering a more effective and personalized recovery plan.
