CHAPTER 4: Evidence-based Screening 163

**Language Matters**

Words and language are critically important in the behavioral health field where discrimination and
disempowerment may hinder people from getting the help they need. Over the last few decades, attention to
appropriateness in language – **person-first language** – has become an established practice by those in health
and behavioral health care, social services, education, and government. Respectful language emphasizes the
person, not the condition or disability.

Person-first language has been widely adopted to replace negative terms that have been used to label people
by their health or behavioral health conditions or disabilities. For instance, expressions such as “person with a
disability” carry neutral rather than derogatory connotations and distinguish the person from their diagnosis or
perceived membership in a group. Language related to substance use and mental health conditions must do the
same.⁴⁰
