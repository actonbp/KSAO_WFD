a successful outcome which allows people to evaluate their choices and learn to make alternate choices and
actions. By supporting dignity of risk and encouraging the client to make choices and take chances, counselors
help clients to combat learned helplessness and bolster self-esteem, self-respect, empowerment, hope and
support recovery.

SHARED DECISION-MAKING

**Shared decision-making (SDM)**
is considered a best practice in
behavioral and physical health
that helps people have informed,
meaningful, and collaborative
discussions with service providers
about their health care services. It
involves tools and resources that
offer objective information. Shared
decision making is the essence of
person-centered care and practice.
Care plans (e.g., treatment, recovery,
discharge plans) should be based
on goals, objectives, and outcome
measures that were developed
through shared decision-making.⁶

1. A dark gray circle with a white "1". Below it, the text reads: "Seek your patient's participation".

The text for the title "The SHARE Approach" is large and prominent. The steps are clearly labeled below each numbered icon.]

Shared decision-making recognizes
that there are often several
treatment approaches and options,
that each one has potential risks and benefits, and that the client's values, goals and preferences influence their
choices. It also recognizes that people are usually free to decide whether or not to follow a clinician's advice.

This is particularly important when it comes to behavioral health care. Common mental health conditions like
depression and anxiety can be treated in many ways, but people with these conditions are often unaware of
different options. For people with an opiate use disorder, medication-assisted treatments are now an option to
consider. SDM educates and empowers persons seeking services to make a choice that best suits them.

Tools, called decision aids can be used to facilitate a shared-decision-making conversation. These tools can help
clients understand the clinical evidence and help them identify their preferences. Decision aids are offered in
a variety of forms, from printed brochures to interactive electronic tools. Decision aids do not advise people or
advocate for one option over another – they prepare people to make informed, values-based decisions with their
health care provider.

Strengths-based Approach

The terms **person-centered** and **strengths-based** are typically used simultaneously. A strengths-based
strategy reflects a shift from a deficit approach to a strengths-based and solution-focused approach. This type
of approach views people not only as capable and possessing a unique array of personal and environmental
strengths, but also challenges service providers to focus their efforts and support toward helping people achieve
life goals and roles that anyone else in the community might pursue.⁷

No single, agreed-upon set of principles for using a strengths-based approach exists. Several leading theorists
of the strengths-based model have articulated principles that apply to working with people who are recovering
from problematic substance use. Two prominent theorists, Charles A. Rapp and Richard J. Goscha, developed six
basic principles for using the model in mental health services.⁸
