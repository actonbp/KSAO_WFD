**SCREENING**

Screening is the process by which the SUD counselor, the client, and available significant others review the current situation, symptoms, and other available information to determine the most appropriate initial course of action – given the client’s needs and characteristics and the available resources. The screening process is also used to help to determine whether the person seeking services is eligible and appropriate for admission to an agency or program or whether they need to be referred to another agency that can help to meet their needs.

The main goal of screening is to identify everyone who might have problematic substance use and/or co-occurring conditions and related service needs. Screening instruments help to determine the immediacy needed for intervention due to specific substance use, health, or life issues. Screening also addresses crisis and any emergency needs. Information collected during screening is generally considered ‘immediate or current’ and observable. This allows the SUD counselor or other health care professional to determine the need for further evaluation and possible immediate treatment or intervention.

Screening typically includes the use of a brief self-report or clinical interview to determine whether someone warrants further assessment. While short screens for SUDs may include as few as four or five key questions, a comprehensive screening process can look for psychoactive substance toxicity, intoxication, and withdrawal symptoms; aggression or danger to others; potential for self-inflicted harm or suicide; and co-occurring MHDs. It can also include exploration of a variety of related service needs including medical, housing, victimization, trauma, and so on.

**Evidence-based Instruments**

The use of **evidence-based screening and assessment instruments** is the recognized and desired standard of care. Evidence-based practices are interventions for which there is consistent scientific evidence showing that they improve client outcomes.⁵⁷ Thus, evidence-based screening and assessment instruments are those that have been extensively researched and have proven effectiveness. It is important, however, to recognize that although various instruments have demonstrated strong effectiveness across administrations and groups of individuals, it is likely that certain populations were not a part of the research studies. For example, there may be no validated assessment tools for SUD in certain populations (e.g., people with intellectual disabilities, specific cultural groups). In these cases, clinicians and researchers often need to use instruments validated in other groups or for other purposes or create/adapt mainstream instruments for their purpose.⁵⁸ The selection of evidence-based screening and assessment instruments may also be influenced by a balance of research evidence with other practical considerations such as ease of accessibility, flexibility and length of administration, and item wording.⁵⁹
