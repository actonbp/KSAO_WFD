CHAPTER 4: Evidence-based Screening 207

6.  **Developing an Interpretive Summary**: The interpretive summary is a critical synthesis of the assessment findings. It outlines the counselor's understanding of the client's substance use disorder, incorporating analysis of the severity, impact, and potential factors contributing to the disorder. This summary provides a foundation for treatment planning, highlighting areas of need and potential interventions.

7.  **Applying Ethical Considerations**: Throughout this process, critical thinking also involves applying ethical considerations, such as confidentiality, informed consent, and cultural sensitivity. The counselor must critically evaluate how these ethical principles impact the assessment process and the development of the interpretive summary.

8.  **Formulating Treatment Recommendations**: Finally, based on the critical analysis and synthesis of information, the counselor formulates personalized treatment recommendations. These recommendations are grounded in evidence-based practices and tailored to the client's unique needs, strengths, and preferences.

Throughout this process, critical thinking enables the counselor to navigate complex information, assess the validity and relevance of data, integrate diverse sources of information, and develop insightful, evidence-based conclusions that guide effective treatment planning for substance use disorders. The counselor then applies a theoretical approach to infer, explain, or interpret the identified themes which this is used to match treatment approaches. ¹²⁰

**Writing the Interpretive Summary**

The interpretive summary is also a tool for engagement and education, offering clients a mirror to their current state and a map towards recovery. It demystifies the clinical assessment process, making the findings accessible and understandable to clients, thereby fostering a collaborative therapeutic relationship. Through this document, clients can see their challenges laid out clearly, understand the basis for their treatment plan, and feel empowered to participate actively in their recovery journey.

**PRIORITIZATION OF NEEDS**

Assessments identify client needs and resources so that SUD counselors can properly assist clients with achieving goals. The intent of the assessment should be identified to help frame the discussion and narrow the focus. Assessments should identify existing resources that can be used to assist the client in achieving goals as well as potential barriers to accessing services or reaching their goals.

SUD counselors can use the framework of **Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs**¹²¹ to prioritize client needs and services. This Hierarchy is an historical and commonly used structure to understand human needs. Maslow’s pyramid is built from the bottom up with physiological needs setting the foundation. The theory states that people will address those needs that are most fundamental and will significantly struggle with being able to adequately address any issue unless all the preceding needs are met. For example, many clients report their

Below this, in smaller text, is "Hierarchical model of human needs". The pyramid levels, from bottom to top, are labeled:
1.  (Bottom, largest section, dark gray/black): Physiological

3.  (Middle section, lighter gray): Love and Belonging
4.  (Second from top, very light gray/white): Esteem
5.  (Top, smallest section, dark gray/black): Self-actualization]
