**AMBIVALENCE**

Consider that most people who need to make a change are **ambivalent** about doing so. They see the reasons to change and reasons not to. Ambivalence is simultaneously wanting and not wanting something or wanting both of two incompatible things. It is fundamental to human nature, and, unfortunately, people can remain stuck there a long time. A common pattern is to think of a reason for changing, and then think of a reason not to change. MI, at its core, is about helping people find a way out of ambivalence and setting a direction for change.

MI is an evidence-based, person-centered approach for helping people resolve ambivalence about changing behaviors. Conversations about behavior change happen on a regular basis in a variety of contexts within helping professions. Although individuals may recognize the value of changing their behavior, they are often reluctant to make changes, due to competing motivations. For example – “*I want to cut down on my drinking because I know it is causing problems in my relationships, but it really helps me cope with the stress in my job.*”

MI is comprised of sets of principals, specific skills, and strategies for working with an individual to reduce ambivalence and identify a clear focus for change. The practice of MI involves the integration of these skills and techniques. As a style of interaction and a set of interviewing skills, MI can be artfully woven into other practices once the SUD counselor achieves confidence and competence in using the MI skills. Someone who is good at MI makes it look fluid and easy; however, skill development in MI is not a one-time learning event. Like developing any complex skill (e.g. playing the piano, learning tennis), MI takes considerable practice with feedback from a supervisor or a coach who is competent as an MI practitioner. More information on MI principles and strategies can be found in Chapter 6.

**A NOTE ABOUT STAGES OF CHANGE**

In Chapter 1, the Transtheoretical Model for Change (TTM) was described as a useful framework to assist SUD counselors understand the process of change and how they can guide people through this process. Prochaska and DiClemente conceptualized the change process as a sequence of stages through which people typically progress as they think about, initiate, and maintain new behaviors.¹⁸ In the early editions of Miller and Rollnick’s publications on Motivational Interviewing, MI strategies were linked to exploration of stage-specific motivational conflicts that could hinder the change progress.

In 2013, Miller and Rollnick indicated that MI and TTM have sometimes been confused as the same concepts.¹⁹ MI is not meant to be a comprehensive theory of change and the TTM stages of change are not an essential part of MI. They are, however, complimentary processes and familiar to many practitioners in the human services. TTM is, therefore, still considered as a foundational piece in understanding the phases or stages that make up the change process.

**Cultural Considerations**

Culture is a process that happens between individuals and groups within communities that shapes personal identity and gives social meaning and significance. Culture also shapes the very meaning of health and approaches to healing at multiple levels. For many ethnic minority individuals and families, the process of engaging in substance use or mental health treatment involves the complex challenge of navigating individual and culturally derived sets of beliefs, attitudes, and practices. As such, cultural considerations are infused throughout this study guide.

As a recovery principle, consideration of culture is important at all levels of operation— individual, programmatic, and organizational—across behavioral health treatment settings. It is also important in all activities and at every treatment phase: outreach, initial contact, screening, assessment, placement, treatment, continuing care and recovery services, research, and education.²⁰ Culturally responsive approaches provide individuals with more opportunities to access services that reflect a cultural perspective to their presenting problems. These services will likely provide a greater sense of safety from the individual’s perspective,
