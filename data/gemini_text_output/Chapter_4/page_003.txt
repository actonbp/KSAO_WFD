**OVERARCHING ISSUES FOR SCREENING AND ASSESSMENT**

**Supporting People in Making Choices**

Person-centered care embodies the recovery movement as it places the person at the heart of everything that is undertaken to facilitate their recovery. Person-centered care and planning are, first and foremost, about always considering the perceptions, needs, “truths,” preferences and priorities, as well as experiences, of the person seeking help. Many health care providers agree with these concepts and feel that they are already person-centered in their daily work. However, being truly person-centered often requires a profound shift in attitudes, policies, and practices.

The focus in a recovery-oriented relationship is assisting people in building their lives in the ways that they desire. This is achieved by actively encouraging the person’s leadership in all aspects of decision-making. Professional expertise remains an essential ingredient, but one that is applied effectively to support informed choice, shared decision-making, and the client’s self-management.

In order to empower people to take a more active role in their treatment and recovery and make informed decisions, there must be an intentional focus on person-centered care used by SUD counselors for collaborative and “productive interactions” about choices and decisions. Secondly, counselors need to use effective decision support strategies that assist the person in understanding choices, making decisions regarding specific service areas, and building capacity to make decisions, in general. These strategies play an important part in operationalizing a person-centered approach.

Respecting clients as partners in the full course of care:
» Emphasizes the importance of autonomy, self-determination, and self-management.
» Adopts a hopeful attitude.
» Actively encourages the client’s participation in all aspects of decision-making.
» Respects and values a client’s inherent worth and importance.
» Affirms a belief in a client’s capacity to recover, thrive, and lead a meaningful and contributing life.
» Celebrates each client’s effort and achievement.⁴

Counselors are often concerned about the ability of the client to make “the right” decisions or think the client will make decisions about their care that can be harmful. Using a person-centered approach requires the counselor to recognize that clinical decision-making is affected by many factors, including how to best reduce risks of harm while promoting the client’s autonomy and personal recovery. The term **dignity of risk** is used to describe the right of individuals to choose to take some risk in engaging in life experiences.⁵ This is also considered as a “right to failure.”

People with substance use and/or mental health conditions may feel subject to a double standard in attitudes towards their ability for self-determination. In the process of receiving professional services, they seem to have somehow given up their “right” to make risky or potentially self-defeating choices without intervention from authorities, clinicians, service providers, or even family members wishing to protect them. Over-protectiveness, taking away people’s choices, or not allowing them to take risks or try new things crushes hope. In addition, when people are denied the dignity of risk, they are denied the opportunity to learn and recover. Part of one’s responsibility in recovery involves the self-management of one’s condition, autonomy in one’s life choices, and the willingness to take informed and planned risks to grow.

One of the biggest barriers is fear – of the unknown, of the legal ramifications, of failure. Counselors worry that if a person takes a risk and fails that it might mean they are doing a bad job. It is important to understand that there are positive aspects of risk. One outcome can be successes to be celebrated; or the risk could not have
