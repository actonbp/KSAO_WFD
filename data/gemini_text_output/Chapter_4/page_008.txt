supporting the belief that culture is essential to healing.²¹

Chapter 9 of this study guide examines important concepts and practices that demonstrate a commitment to
cultural responsiveness – among those, cultural humility and cultural competence. **Cultural humility** refers
to the counselor’s ability to maintain an interpersonal stance that is other-oriented (or open to the other) in
relation to aspects of cultural identity that are most important to the client.²² This encompasses the counselor’s
openness to accepting that their own cultural identities and experiences will limit their perspective and
awareness in understanding the cultural experiences of others. Specific attitudes and practices include openness,
respect, consideration, humility, and interest regarding the client’s cultural identity and experiences.²³

**Culturally competent** counselors are aware of their own culture and values, and they acknowledge their own
assumptions and biases about other cultures. Moreover, culturally competent counselors strive to understand
how these assumptions affect their ability to provide culturally responsive services to individuals from similar
or diverse cultures. Cultural competence includes addressing the person individually rather than applying
general treatment approaches based on assumptions and biases. This highlights the need for counselors, to take
time to build a relationship with each person they serve, to understand their preferences, and to assess for and
access services that will meet their needs.²⁴

**Trauma**

Chapter 2 examined the importance of understanding the impact of trauma on people with substance use and
co-occurring conditions. In short, not addressing traumatic stress symptoms, trauma-specific disorders, and
other symptoms/disorders related to trauma can impede successful substance use screening, assessment and
treatment planning. In addition, unrecognized and ignored trauma symptoms can lead to poor engagement in
treatment, premature termination, greater risk for relapse of psychological symptoms or substance use, and
worse outcomes.²⁵

Effective screening and assessment can prevent misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment planning. People
with histories of trauma often display symptoms that meet criteria for other disorders. Without screening,
clients’ trauma histories and related symptoms often go undetected, leading providers to direct services toward
symptoms and disorders that may only partially explain client presentations and distress. Universal screening
for trauma history and trauma-related symptoms can help SUD counselors identify individuals at risk of
developing more pervasive and severe symptoms of traumatic stress.²⁶

In the center, a Black woman with short curly hair and glasses, wearing a light-colored top, is speaking and gesturing with both hands. To her left, a Black man with short hair, wearing a light-colored t-shirt, is attentively listening, with his head slightly tilted. To the woman's right, a portion of a third person with long dark hair is visible. The lighting is somewhat dim, creating areas of deep shadow and highlighting the subjects.]
