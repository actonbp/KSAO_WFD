CHAPTER 4: Evidence-based Screening 205

**Level of Care Utilization System for Psychiatric and Addiction Services (LOCUS)**¹¹⁷

The Level of Care Utilization System for Psychiatric and Addiction Services (LOCUS) is a standardized tool designed to evaluate the service needs of individuals with psychiatric and/or substance use disorders. Developed by the American Association of Community Psychiatrists, LOCUS is intended to assist counselors, care managers, and mental health professionals in making consistent and objective decisions regarding the most appropriate level of care for people. The system is based on a comprehensive assessment of the individual’s clinical situation across six dimensions:

1.  **Risk of Harm** – Evaluates the potential risk the individual poses to themselves or others.
2.  **Functional Status** – Assesses the individual’s ability to maintain daily activities and responsibilities.
3.  **Comorbidity** – Considers the presence of co-occurring mental health or substance use disorders.
4.  **Recovery Environment** – Looks at the individual’s living situation, support system, and any environmental stressors or supports.
5.  **Treatment and Recovery History** – Reviews the individual’s past and current treatment experiences, including responses and adherence.
6.  **Engagement and Treatment Acceptance** – Assesses the individual’s willingness and readiness to participate in treatment.

Based on the assessment across these dimensions, LOCUS provides a recommendation for one of six levels of care, ranging from least intensive (e.g., outpatient services) to most intensive (e.g., inpatient hospitalization). Each level of care is defined by a combination of service variables: the care environment, clinical services, support services and crisis stabilization and prevention services. A menu of available service options is constructed for each service intensity level, based partly on local resources, that fall within defined parameters. This consideration of multiple dimensions of an individual’s condition ensures a holistic view of their needs, supporting more tailored and effective care planning.

The word "HOSPITAL" is visible in large, capital letters on the facade of the building, with "University of Iowa" in smaller letters underneath it, though "University of Iowa" is partially obscured. The sky is light and cloudy.]
