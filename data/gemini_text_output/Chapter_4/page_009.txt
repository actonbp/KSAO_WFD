ENGAGING THE CLIENT

Making a connection between the client and the counselor or the program is known as engagement. All too
often, the work of engagement is taken for granted. Usually, clients arrive at substance use or mental health
facilities in active crisis or otherwise seeking help. While staff must certainly know how to respond to any
client’s presenting needs, they must also know how to ensure that the client feels welcomed, respected, listened
to, and understood.

The first moments of interaction between a counselor and a person seeking care can set the tone and course of
treatment. This first interaction can start a journey to recovery and a satisfying life—or it can leave a person
unsure or even hopeless about their future and unwilling to go back a second time.27 Unsuccessful engagement
may lead to poor clinical outcomes and a return to problematic substance use. When clients are deeply engaged,
however, they are more likely to bond with counselors, support treatment goals, participate willingly in
assessment and treatment activities, remain in treatment as recommended and, ultimately, to successfully
achieve and maintain recovery.28

Engagement can be challenging. People with lived experience of an SUD commonly report feeling devalued and
dismissed by many of the professionals with whom they come into contact. Key themes include feeling excluded
from decisions, receiving subtle or overt threats of coercive treatment, being made to wait excessively long when
seeking help, being given insufficient information about one’s condition or treatment options, being treated in
a demeaning manner, being told they would never get well, and being spoken to or about using stigmatizing
language.29, 30 Many practical strategies and tools can be used to improve engagement. Implementing these
strategies requires counselors (and other program staff) to also feel engaged with the work they are doing.

Welcoming Strategies

Engagement begins when a program makes initial contact with clients or family members and is enhanced by
a warm, inviting environment and respectful, nonjudgmental interactions between clients and program staff at
all levels. Thus, engagement is facilitated by a welcoming approach.

The first strategy for providing a welcoming atmosphere includes having a pleasant physical environment,
offering refreshments, and being greeted by friendly staff. Offering privacy for initial interviews can also help
clients to feel more comfortable. Importantly, treating all clients and their family members with respect related
to their ethnic, cultural and linguistic diversity, sexual orientation and gender identity, religious and spiritual
background, age, and socioeconomic issues is also essential to helping clients feel welcomed.

Once individuals are in contact with the program, they stand on the far side of a yet-to-be-established
therapeutic relationship. It is up to counselors and other staff members to bridge the gap. Handshakes, facial
expressions, greetings, and small talk are simple gestures that establish a first impression and begin building
the therapeutic relationship.31

Welcoming is not just a matter of everyone being nicer. Welcoming involves a deliberate approach in using these
strategies as a “clinical practice” and to building a welcoming environment throughout the organizational
culture.32 This requires a purposeful implementation strategy that supports and empowers staff to produce the
“product” of welcoming, plus empowering the practice of welcoming with clients.

A welcoming outreach approach will:
» Make the first contact personal and engaging.
» Be deliberately and systematically applied to clinical and non-clinical aspects of the organization.
» Treat all individuals and their family members equally and with respect related to their ethnic, cultural,
and linguistic diversity, sexual orientation and gender identity, religious and spiritual background, age
and socioeconomic issues.
