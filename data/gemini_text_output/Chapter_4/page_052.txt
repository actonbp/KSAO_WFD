204 IC&RC Alcohol and Drug Counselor (ADC) Certification Examination Study Guide

» **Level 3. Residential.** Services in this level are designed for individuals experiencing significant functional impairments due to SUD or requiring a higher level of stability than what can be achieved at home. Residential treatment programs provide round-the-clock care, seven days a week.

> **3.1 Clinically Managed Low-Intensity Residential Services.** Residential services at this level consist of a setting where people live, such as a group home. Individuals receive a minimum of five hours of clinical services weekly, focusing on teaching essential recovery skills such as relapse prevention and emotional management. Services include outpatient recovery support, a structured living environment, 24-hour staffing, house meetings, and a community promoting life skills development.

> **3.5 Clinically Managed High-Intensity Residential Services.** This level is for individuals who require a structured environment and intensive care but do not need the full medical resources of a hospital-based program. This level of care is suitable for those with severe SUDs who need 24-hour support. Individuals engage in intensive group therapy, individual counseling, and other therapeutic modalities that address substance use disorders, co-occurring MHDs, and behavioral issues.

> **3.7 Medically Monitored Intensive Inpatient Services.** This level is for individuals requiring intensive inpatient care due to withdrawal risks or other medical needs necessitating close observation, treatment, or follow-up. It is especially beneficial for those who have experienced repeated recurrences of substance use or who have not succeeded in lower levels of care due to complex needs that require an immersive, supportive environment to achieve sustained recovery.

» **Level 4. Medically Managed Inpatient Services.** As the most intense level of treatment, this level has the highest and most intensive level of care for those with severe conditions that require acute medical intervention. This level is provided in a hospital setting or a facility that offers 24-hour nursing care and daily physician care, catering to individuals with severe and complex medical conditions, and MHDs. Combining high-level medical and clinical oversight, services include drug and alcohol detoxification, medication-assisted treatment, daily physician consultations, and comprehensive management of co-occurring disorders. Despite the medical focus, therapeutic interventions such as individual therapy, group sessions, and family counseling are integral components of treatment, with the goal to stabilize the individual’s conditions rapidly and safely.

The 4th edition of ASAM’s criteria updated the six dimensions that are used to create a holistic, biopsychosocial assessment of an individual to be used service placement, planning and treatment across all services and levels of care. The six dimensions are:
1.  Intoxication, Withdrawal and Addiction Medications
2.  Biomedical Conditions
3.  Psychiatric and Cognitive Conditions
4.  Substance Use-Related Risks
5.  Recovery Environment Interactions
6.  Person-Centered Considerations

Each of the four levels of care, in combination with the six dimensions, is designed to provide a continuum of services that can be tailored to meet the individual needs of those with substance use disorders, ranging from those who need minimal intervention to those who require intensive and medically managed inpatient services.

The intended use of the ASAM Criteria encourages (and in some states – mandates) service providers to conduct a standard, multidimensional assessment as people enter treatment, covering the six dimensions described above; use the results to determine the appropriate level of care to meet each patient’s needs; and develop an individualized treatment plan. As people progress through treatment, providers use these same assessment and treatment matching processes to determine whether to increase or decrease the level of care to best meet evolving treatment needs.
