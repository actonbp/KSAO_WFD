Confirmatory drug testing is like a detective work in science, where the goal is to accurately identify and
measure drugs in specific samples. Over time, the tools and techniques used for confirmation tests have evolved
significantly. The popular method in the past several decades has been Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry
(GC/MS). This method was “the gold standard” because it was very accurate at identifying and measuring
specific drugs in samples.

However, as the need to test for multiple drugs at one time increased, and the demand for faster results grew,
scientists started to look for more advanced techniques. Newer Multi-Target Screening (MTS) procedures are
being used such as Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) which is a sophisticated analytical tool
that first separates complex mixtures into individual components and then identifies each component based
on its mass. This means it can test for many different drugs in a single run, making it much faster and more
efficient. This makes LC-MS incredibly useful for analyzing complex samples in fields such as pharmaceuticals,
drug test analysis, and biochemistry, where knowing the exact composition of a sample is crucial. This evolution
allows for quicker and more comprehensive drug test results, which is crucial in ensuring accuracy and
timeliness.¹⁰¹

CUT-OFF LEVELS

The US Department of Health and Human Services
(DHHS, SAMHSA) establishes the Mandatory Guidelines
for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs, which
many other departments, including Department of
Transportation, follow for regulated drug testing. These
guidelines specify the initial and confirmatory drug test
cut-off levels for substances such as marijuana, cocaine,
opiates (including codeine, morphine, and heroin),
amphetamines (including methamphetamine, MDMA),
and PCP.

The SAMHSA guidelines serve as a key benchmark for
drug testing, including within SUD treatment programs,
which often follow these federal guidelines to ensure
consistency, reliability, and legal compliance – especially
when they are part of a network that receives federal
funding or must comply with federal regulations. The
use of SAMHSA’s cut-off scores helps these programs
to standardize their testing procedures and to make
informed decisions about treatment plans based on
objective criteria. However, it’s important to note that
while many SUD treatment programs may adhere to
SAMHSA guidelines, there can be variations based on
the specific policies of the program, state regulations, or
the requirements of insurance providers. Some programs
might use different cut-off levels or additional tests for
substances not covered by SAMHSA guidelines, depending
on their clinical judgment, the population they serve, or
other factors.

These values were developed to help eliminate **false positive results**. A false positive occurs when the test
incorrectly indicates the presence of a drug or its metabolites in an individual’s sample, even though the person
did not actually use that substance. Reasons for false positives include:

» **Cross-Reactivity**: Some substances can chemically resemble the targeted drug in a test, leading to cross-
reactivity where the test cannot distinguish between the drug and the other substance.
