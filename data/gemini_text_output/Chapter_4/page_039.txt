CHAPTER 4: Evidence-based Screening 191

ongoing role in treating individuals who may
be or have been suicidal. Therefore, the ability
to provide suicide safe care should be a core
responsibility of behavioral health settings,
and competence and confidence in working
with these individuals are essential.

Here is their recommended standard of care:

» On intake and periodically, **assess all
individuals for suicide risk** using a
standardized instrument or scale.

» Stratify all individuals according to
the level of risk.

> Based on the level of risk, asking
probing questions about suicidal
ideation, plans, intent, and
lethality will be necessary.

> For those who have presented
with a recent attempt, inquiry
should be made about all these
aspects when the individuals the
attempt and also their current
suicidal ideation. Past attempts
should also be probed with special
reference to attempts made in the
recent past and the most severe
attempts.

» For all individuals with elevated risk:

> As part of the treatment plan, complete a collaborative safety plan during the same visit.

> As part of safety planning, provide information on telephone crisis lines, including the National
Suicide Prevention Lifeline. Carry out steps to reduce access to lethal means, including asking family
members and significant others to assist.

> Engage the individual in treatment with a licensed or other appropriately credentialed professional,
preferably one who has training in suicide, including risk assessment and safety planning.

» Reassess risk and review and/or update the individual’s safety plan at every visit until the risk is
reduced.⁹²

As with other screening and assessment instruments and tools, there is a variety of choices that have a strong
research evidence base whether it’s to screen for immediate risk, to measure the severity of suicidal ideation,
or to explore behaviors associated with increased risk. The choice of tool depends on the clinical setting, the
population being served, and the specific needs of the assessment process. It’s also important to note that these
tools should be used as part of a comprehensive assessment, including clinical interview and consideration of
the individual’s history, circumstances, and mental health status.
