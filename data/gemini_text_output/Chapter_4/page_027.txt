assessment process. This base knowledge supports early identification, accurate assessment, effective treatment planning, comprehensive care, client safety, and the development of therapeutic relationships. **Appendix D** contains lists of indicators and common signs and symptoms for problematic substance use.

The types of assessment methods for SUD are varied and include structured interviews, evidence-based tools, self-report questionnaires, clinician ratings, and biological measures.

**SUBSTANCE USE AND MENTAL HEALTH ASSESSMENT METHODS**

**1. Structured Interviews:**
    >   **Diagnostic Interviews**: Conducted by trained professionals, these interviews use standardized criteria, such as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5-TR)⁷⁰, to determine the presence and severity of a substance use disorder.
    >   **Comprehensive Assessment**: A more in-depth interview that is used to convey substance use but also co-occurring disorders, psychosocial factors, and the individual's medical history.

**2. Evidence-based Assessments and Tests**: Standardized assessments, tests, and questionnaires (e.g., GAIN-I, Addiction Severity Index, Beck Depression Inventory) can effectively identify, diagnose, and monitor substance use and its related disorders.

**3. Observational Methods**: Counselors and other health care providers may look for physical signs of substance use or withdrawal, such as changes in appearance, behavior, or physical health indicators.

**4. Self-Report Questionnaires**: Clients provide information about their substance use, including types of substances used, frequency, quantity, and any associated risks or behaviors. These are also used for mental health issues like depression, anxiety, PTSD, etc. These can be filled out by clients ahead of appointments.
