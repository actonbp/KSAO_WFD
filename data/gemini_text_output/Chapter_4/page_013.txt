CHAPTER 4: Evidence-based Screening
165

**SETTING THE STAGE FOR EFFECTIVE SCREENING AND ASSESSMENT**

The processes involved in screening and assessment are underpinned by an important set of skills that: (1) establishes rapport and an effective working alliance with the client; (2) facilitates a welcoming atmosphere for interviewing and service delivery; and, (3) assists in motivating and engaging the client in identified service needs. As the first contact with the client is critical, the perception of the counselor or interviewer as respectful, nonjudgmental, and attentive to creating a strong connection in which the client feels valued and understood.

**Working or “Therapeutic” Alliance**

Building a strong therapeutic or working alliance with clients involves several key skills and approaches. The development of an alliance begins with the first interaction and develops over time. The importance of the working relationship should not be underestimated. Having a knowledgeable, understanding, and approachable counselor is vital to promoting and maintaining engagement. A working alliance is based on establishing trust and a healthy rapport, which provides the foundation for a candid dialogue and an effective problem-solving relationship.

**Empathy**

The term “empathy” is used to describe a wide range of experiences. Empathy is generally defined as the ability to sense other people’s emotions, coupled with the ability to imagine what someone else might be thinking or feeling. Empathy starts with the belief that it is valuable to take the time to clearly understand the other person’s perspective, exhibiting a sense of curiosity and openness, and abandoning judgment about how a person views the world.

There are two types of empathy:42

» **Cognitive empathy** is the ability to perceive emotions in others and the capacity to imagine their experiences by simulating them in our mind to see the world from their point of view. This allows us to gain an understanding of their experiences of the world. (UNDERSTAND)

» **Affective empathy** is the way a person feels emotionally when confronted with the suffering of another person. Empathy can trigger the brain to mirror and respond as if we are feeling similar experiences as other people. We hear about a painful experience someone else went through and, for most people, our brain responds as if we are feeling a similar pain even though we have never been in such a situation.43 (FEEL)

Empathy allows people to feel respected and validated, particularly in their experience of difficult situations. The display of empathy is integral to promoting client change44 and will help the alliance between counselor and client. The empathetic relationship of counselors with their clients reinforces their cooperation towards designing a therapeutic plan with interventions based on person-centered practices and increases the client’s satisfaction from the therapeutic process as a whole.45
