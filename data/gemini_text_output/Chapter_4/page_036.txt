Risk assessments for violence are usually addressed along two paths.
The first is violence risk assessment to estimate and attempt to limit the
likelihood that a violent event will occur. While this type of assessment
is highly desirable, this type of assessment of risk is exceptionally
difficult to do well. There are challenges inherent in making such
judgments and the consequences of erroneous decisions can have serious
repercussions.⁷⁸

Risk assessment focuses on the probability of violence. It is an estimate
for an individual, who usually has a history of violence, based upon
their comparison to a known group. In contrast, a threat assessment
focuses on targeted violence by a person of concern, who may not have a
known history of violence, and encompasses a behavioral and profiling
focus. There are many variables and contexts to consider, resulting in a
complex process.

Violence risk can be evaluated through formal risk assessment
instruments and may consider factors such as offending trajectories,
including the age of onset, severity, frequency, and personality traits.
Risk consideration focuses on individual factors and extends to
family, community, and cultural factors. No two individuals are alike;
consequently, preventing harm is not a simple task. The factors that lead
to adverse outcomes, such as violence, suicide, and related outcomes,
vary by the individual. It is, therefore, necessary to understand each
individual’s particular vulnerabilities and strengths related to such
events.⁷⁹

The white paper has the words "Reduce Risk" printed on it in a large, bold, black, serif font. The paper appears to be peeled or torn from the top, creating a three-dimensional effect and suggesting something is being revealed or emphasized. The background has a rough texture, resembling coarse fabric or a distressed surface.]
