**Stigma**

Problematic substance use is one of the most heavily stigmatized health conditions.³³ Stigma, can be subtle or it can be obvious—but no matter the magnitude, it can lead to harm. **Stigma** is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a place, or a nation. The term represents a mixture of attitudes, beliefs, behaviors, and structures that interact at different levels of society (i.e., individuals, groups, organizations, systems).

Stigma involves two primary components – a **label** and a **stereotype.**³⁴

1. The label (e.g., “addict”) links the person to a set of undesirable characteristics that work to form a stereotype (i.e., beliefs held about a group of people with an SUD).

2. When a person links a label to another person, and they believe the stereotype, they react negatively to the person. For example, a stereotype might be – *people with SUDs are dangerous, incapable of managing treatment, or at fault for their condition*. This can result in the person placing a more social distance from the person with a SUD, engaging in discriminatory ways, or supporting potentially harmful activities towards the stereotyped individual.

There are three primary types of stigma.

» **Public stigma** involves the negative or discriminatory attitudes that others have about substance use, misuse, and people with SUDs. Individuals with SUDs are likely to be seen as dangerous and unpredictable, unable to make decisions about treatment or are to be blamed for their own condition.³⁵ These negative attitudes may lead to unfair treatment and discrimination. Public stigma can also contribute to self-stigma for individuals with SUD, causing feelings of marginalization and social exclusion³⁶ and acting as a barrier to help-seeking and treatment.³⁷

The paper has "STOP STIGMA" written on it in large, block, hatched letters. The word "STOP" is above "STIGMA". Two push pins are visible, one to the left of the paper and one below it. The bottom right corner of the paper is slightly curled up, and some faint lines suggesting a graph or chart are visible underneath the curled corner.]

» **Self-stigma** refers to the negative attitudes that people with SUDs have about their own condition. Self-stigmatization results from public stigmatization when a person internalizes the negative stereotypes associated with their SUD.³⁸ This changes their perceptions of themselves – as less deserving, as blameworthy and powerless. People who self-stigmatize may experience embarrassment and shame. They may avoid social interactions and have difficulty managing their recovery process.

» **Institutional stigma** is more systemic, involving policies of government and private organizations that intentionally or unintentionally limit opportunities for people with an SUD. For example, In the workforce, people with an SUD may not be able to get a job, keep a job or be promoted.³⁹
