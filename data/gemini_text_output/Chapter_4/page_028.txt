5.  **Digital Health Platforms:** This includes the use of apps and online platforms that provide tools for self-monitoring and reporting substance use, triggers, and cravings. Some platforms also provide educational resources or interventions. Online apps for mental health screening and monitoring have increased. These tools can track mood, behaviors, and symptoms over time, providing data for assessment.

6.  **Biological Testing:**
    ›   **Urine, Blood, Hair, and Saliva Tests:** These can confirm recent or chronic substance use, providing objective data to supplement self-reported information.
    ›   **Breathalyzers:** Commonly used for alcohol screening to measure blood alcohol concentration (BAC) non-invasively.

7.  **Collateral Information:**
    ›   **Reports from Family or Friends:** Input from close contacts can provide additional perspectives on the individual's substance use patterns and impacts.
    ›   **Reports from Referral Sources:** Medical, employment, and/or legal records, and previous treatment records to provide a comprehensive understanding of the individual's substance use and its impact.

8.  **Assessment of Readiness to Change:** Tools like the Transtheoretical Model (Prochaska and DiClemente) assess an individual's readiness to engage in treatment and change behaviors, guiding personalized intervention strategies.

9.  **Recovery:** Measurements of recovery capital such as the Assessment of Recovery Capital (ARC) and the Strengths and Barriers Recovery Scale (SABRS) are brief and easy to administer and can be a useful complement in the assessment process.

**HEALTH CONDITIONS**

1.  **Questionnaires and Self-Reports:** Used for initial screening of various conditions, including cardiovascular risk factors, diabetes, and more. These tools can gather information about symptoms, lifestyle, and family history.

2.  **Physical Exams:** A comprehensive physical examination by a health care provider can identify signs of various health conditions, from cardiovascular issues to potential malignancies.

3.  **Blood Tests:** Used to screen for conditions like diabetes, high cholesterol, thyroid dysfunction, and infections. Blood tests can provide a wealth of information about the body's functioning.

4.  **Imaging Tests:** Techniques such as X-rays, MRI, CT scans, and ultrasounds are used to visualize internal structures of the body, helping in the diagnosis of conditions like fractures, tumors, and organ issues.

5.  **Genetic Testing:** Used to identify genetic predispositions to certain conditions, such as breast cancer (BRCA1/2 gene mutations), heart disease, and more.

**Collateral Data Resources**

Many information sources may be used to **obtain relevant history and related information to establish eligibility and appropriateness, and to facilitate the assessment process.** These sources include the client as well as other pertinent collateral sources. Interviews with the client are more comprehensive than the brief interviews used for screening with a more thorough and systematic method of gathering information. Such interviews can reveal valuable information about the person that complements recorded or archival information and helps to provide an accurate evaluation of the person's problems and needs. An assessment interview may also be the foundation for a positive, trusting relationship between the counselor and the client.
