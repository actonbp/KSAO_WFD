CHAPTER 4: Evidence-based Screening 171

**Widely Used Evidence-based Screening Instruments for SUDs⁶⁰,⁶¹**

The **Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT)** was developed by the World Health Organization It is a simple 10-question tool designed to screen for excessive drinking. It has been validated in a wide range of settings and cultures.

The **Drug Use Disorders Identification Test (DUDIT)** is a screening tool aimed at identifying individuals with drug use problems and disorders. It consists of a series of questions that cover various aspects of drug use, including patterns of use, drug-related behaviors, and the psychological and social consequences of drug use. The DUDIT is designed to complement the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) for a comprehensive assessment of substance use.

The **Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST 10)** is a brief diagnostic instrument designed to screen for the problematic use of drugs other than alcohol. Comprising 10 items, it assesses drug use behaviors and potential drug-related problems. The DAST-10 is widely used in clinical and research settings to identify individuals who may benefit from further assessment, intervention, or treatment for substance use issues.

The **Cut down, Annoyed, Guilty, and Eye-opener (CAGE) questionnaire** is a concise and widely used screening tool for identifying potential problems with alcohol. It asks individuals about their need to cut down on drinking, annoyance at criticism about their drinking, feelings of guilt about drinking, and whether they need a morning drink to steady their nerves or to get rid of a hangover. The simplicity and brevity of the CAGE questionnaire make it a valuable tool for initial screening in various settings.

The **Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST)** screens for risky substance use. Developed by the World Health Organization (WHO), the ASSIST identifies the use of tobacco, alcohol, and other substances, assessing the risks associated with their use rather than diagnosing substance use disorders. The ASSIST is structured to be administered by a health worker or trained staff within a few minutes, making it suitable for use in a variety of healthcare settings.

The **Brief Screener for Tobacco, Alcohol, and Other Drugs (BSTAD)** is designed to quickly assess the use of tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drugs among clients and young adults. Developed with the support of NIDA, the BSTAD aims to identify individuals who may be at risk for substance use disorders. It asks about the frequency and types of substance use, including tobacco products, alcohol, marijuana, and other illicit drugs, over a specified period, typically the past year or past month. The strength of the BSTAD lies in its brevity and ease of administration.

The **Car, Relax, Alone, Friends/Family, Forget, Trouble (CRAFFT) Screening Test** is a brief, self-administered tool designed to screen individuals for high-risk alcohol and other drug use disorders simultaneously. It asks about substance use in contexts that may indicate risk (e.g., using while driving, using to relax, using when alone), with the goal of identifying young people who may need further assessment, intervention, or treatment for substance use issues.
