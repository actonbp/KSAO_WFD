**The Cannabis Use Problems Identification Test (CUPIT)** is designed to identify individuals who may have problematic or harmful patterns of cannabis use. It assesses the frequency of use, dependence symptoms, and the psychological and social impacts of cannabis consumption. The goal of CUPIT is to help healthcare professionals determine if an individual's cannabis use is risky and if they might benefit from further evaluation or intervention.

**The Global Appraisal of Individual Needs - Short Screener (GAIN-SS)** is a brief, comprehensive screening tool designed to identify individuals who may have substance abuse and MHDs. It is used across various settings to quickly assess the need for further evaluation in areas such as substance use, mental health status, crime/violence risk, and environmental risk factors. The GAIN-SS helps in directing individuals to the appropriate level of care.

**The Tobacco, Alcohol, Prescription medication, and other Substance use (TAPS) Tool** is a screening and assessment instrument designed to evaluate the use of these substances in individuals. It identifies the level and type of substance use, including tobacco, alcohol, prescription medications (used non-medically), and illicit drugs.

**The Opioid Risk Tool (ORT) for Opioid Use Disorder (OUD)** is a self-report screening instrument designed to predict the risk of opioid use disorder among people being considered for opioid therapy for pain management. It assesses factors such as personal and family history of substance abuse, age, history of pre-client sexual abuse, and psychological diseases.

**The Adult Substance Abuse Subtle Screening Inventory - 4 (SASSI-4)** identifies high or low probability of SUDs and includes a prescription drug scale that identifies individuals likely to be abusing prescription medications. It also provides a measure of profile validity and clinical insight into level of defensiveness and willingness to acknowledge experienced consequences of substance use disorder.

**The adolescent version - Adolescent Substance Abuse Subtle Screening Inventory (SASSI-A3)** - identifies high or low probability of SUDs in clients 13 to 18 years of age. The SASSI-A3 also addresses family and social risk factors, level of defensive responding, consequences of substance misuse teens endorsed, and a prescription drug abuse scale that identifies teens likely to be abusing prescription medication.

**The Screening to Brief Intervention (S2BI)** is designed to quickly assess the frequency of substance use (including tobacco, alcohol, and drugs) among adolescents and young adults. It categorizes substance use into three levels: non-use, use, and problematic use, based on the frequency of use reported. The S2BI is intended to facilitate early identification of substance use behaviors. Its simple format allows for easy integration into clinical settings, helping to prompt conversations about substance use and related health interventions.
