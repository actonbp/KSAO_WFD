There are many important communication skills; here are some key skills.

**1 Active Listening** is the foundation of effective
communication, involving paying full attention to
the speaker, understanding their message, providing
feedback, and responding appropriately. Active listening helps
establish trust between parties. Active listening involves
making a conscious effort to hear not only the words that
another person is saying but, more importantly, try to
understand the complete message being sent.⁵² When the
counselor truly listens and shows empathy for others, the
climate is set so the person can feel “safe” in speaking up with
questions, concerns, or confidential information.

It takes a lot of concentration and determination to be an active
listener. This requires the listener to set aside all other thoughts¨
and behaviors and concentrate on the message – and then ask
questions, reflect, and paraphrase to ensure they understand the
message.

Here are some key active listening techniques.⁵³

1.  **Pay Attention.** One goal is to set a comfortable tone that gives the other person an opportunity to think
    and speak. Allow “wait time” before responding. Don’t cut the person off, finish their sentences, or start
    formulating an answer before they’ve finished. Pay attention to personal body language as well as your
    frame of mind when engaging in active listening. Be focused on the moment, make eye contact, and
    operate from a place of respect as the listener.
2.  **Provide Feedback.** Our personal filters, assumptions, judgments, and beliefs can distort what we hear.
    This may require reflection (clarifying and paraphrasing) what is being said and asking questions. “What
    I’m hearing is…” and “Sounds like you are saying…” are great ways to reflect. This also includes skills such
    as: Focusing – helping to direct the person’s attention to a single topic, and Summarizing – putting
    together key ideas and feelings into a brief statement.
3.  **Defer Judgment.** Even when good listeners have strong views, they suspend judgment, hold any
    criticisms, and avoid interruptions like arguing or making their point right away.
4.  **Respond Appropriately.** Active listening is a model for respect and understanding. The listener needs
    to resist the need to immediately respond with a better or different insight. It is important to gain
    information and perspective. Listeners should be candid, open, and honest in their responses and provide
    opinions respectfully.

**2 Nonverbal communication** involves aspects of communication other than the actual words used.
This involves factors such as voice, eye contact, posture and body movements, facial expressions,
gestures, touch, and proximity. There are several elements of one’s voice including tone, volume, rate,
and inflections that are critical elements of nonverbal communication. All these factors dictate that
counselors be aware of their nonverbal communication so they can recognize potentially problematic body
