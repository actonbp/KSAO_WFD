main area of concern is their personal relationships (love and belongingness) or how they feel about themselves (self-esteem). These concerns, however, are often intertwined with, and overshadowed by, physiological, safety, or security needs.

As noted in this chapter, many psychosocial screening and assessment tools are global and provide an overview of the client's current strengths, challenges, barriers, and goals. Others are very specific to a certain behavior or emotion including those that screen for anxiety, depression, suicide risk, trauma, and alcohol use. These tools, as well as other interview and collateral data, can serve as a basis for prioritization of strategies that can be used to meet those needs.

**STRUCTURE OF THE INTERPRETIVE SUMMARY**

The counselor must provide a written summary of these clinical interpretations and recommendations for appropriate treatment and other services. There are several names (e.g. biopsychosocial assessment, psychosocial evaluation, multi-dimensional assessment, etc.) for the type of summary that reflects the multifaceted approach to understanding and addressing behavioral health issues. The choice of term may depend on the professional setting, the specific focus of the assessment, or the theoretical orientation of the practitioner. For this study guide, the term **interpretative summary** is used.

There is no standard formula for writing the interpretive summary, although many organizations use a prescribed format for the assessment summary or have a required format is required by funders. An interpretive summary that follows the assessment process for substance use disorders is a comprehensive overview that can examine the individual's condition through three lenses: biological, psychological, and social factors. This summary is crucial in understanding the multifaceted nature of SUDs and in developing an effective treatment plan. Here is one example of a comprehensive, structured format for creating an interpretive summary for SUD assessment:

**1. Introduction**
    »   Brief overview of the purpose of the biopsychosocial assessment.
    »   Initial observations and reasons for assessment (e.g., referral source, presenting problem).

**2. Biological Factors**
    »   **Substance Use History:** Types of substances used, patterns of use (frequency, quantity), age of first use, and periods of abstinence or relapse.
    »   **Family History:** Discussion on family history of SUDs or related MHDs.
    »   **Neurobiological Factors:** Any known issues with brain chemistry or structure that may influence substance use behavior.
    »   **Physical Health:** Current physical health status, including any chronic conditions, and how these may impact or be impacted by substance use.

**3. Psychological Factors**
    »   **Mental Health History:** History of mental health conditions, including any diagnoses, treatments, and responses to treatments.
    »   **Cognitive Functions:** Assessment of cognitive abilities, including memory, attention, and executive function, and any impacts from substance use.
    »   **Emotional State:** Current emotional state, including any symptoms of depression, anxiety, or other mood disorders.
    »   **Personality Traits:** Relevant personality traits or disorders that may influence substance use behavior.
    »   **Motivation for Change:** Level of readiness to engage in treatment and make lifestyle changes.
