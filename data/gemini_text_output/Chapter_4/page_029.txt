CHAPTER 4: Evidence-based Screening 181

There may already be existing information about the client that has been gathered and recorded by other
professionals. Written reports and records from schools, employers, previous treatment experiences, and
criminal justice agencies also contain information that may be relevant to the client’s substance use problems.
Interviews may be conducted to get current information to supplement written records. In addition to the
client, other possible informants include parents, teachers, peers, employers, and significant others (referred
to as collateral sources). Of course, collateral sources, including parents, spouses, and other family members,
cannot be contacted for information without the client’s written consent. Finally, testing instruments, including
drug testing, can be used to verify or confirm information collected by other methods. Screeners and assessors
must use multiple sources in conjunction with a client report because relying on any one source may lead to an
underestimate or overestimate of the problem.

Previous treatment or other service records may be the most *objective* source of information that is obtained
during the assessment since these records have been completed by professionals who have been trained in
behavioral health services and who do not have an emotional investment in the perspective they present. It is
important to realize that some of the information received in this way may not be timely or may no longer be
accurate. Care should be taken to confirm that any information gathered from existing records is still valid
before relying on it to make treatment recommendations.

**Evidence-based Assessments**

As noted earlier, the use of evidence-based assessment instruments helps to bolster the reliability of client self-
reports.

**Widely Used Evidence-based Assessment Instruments for SUDs**

The **GAIN-I, or Global Appraisal of Individual Needs - Initial,** is a comprehensive biopsychosocial assessment
tool designed to evaluate the various life areas of individuals, particularly focusing on substance use and
related issues. The GAIN-I is a proprietary instrument that is part of a family of instruments that facilitate
the diagnosis, treatment planning, and outcome monitoring of individuals with complex behavioral health
needs. The tool is structured to allow for a systematic collection of data over a person’s lifetime as well as in
the past 90 days, ensuring that both historical and current needs are assessed. The assessment covers areas
such as:

1.  **Substance Use:** Evaluates the frequency, duration, and intensity of alcohol, drug, and tobacco use.
2.  **Physical Health:** Assesses health status, physical conditions, and related needs.
3.  **Mental Health:** Screens for symptoms of common MHDs, including depression, anxiety, trauma, and
    psychotic disorders.
4.  **Risk Behaviors:** Identifies behaviors that increase the risk of harm to self or others.
5.  **Environmental and Social Support:** Looks at living conditions, social networks, and support systems.
6.  **Legal:** Reviews legal issues and involvement with the criminal justice system.
7.  **Vocational:** Assesses employment status, history, and educational needs.

The GAIN-I generates several types of scores that inform treatment planning, including severity indices
for each main domain, which help in prioritizing treatment needs and interventions. It is designed to be
administered by trained professionals through an interview format, and it can take between 1 to 2 hours to
complete, depending on the respondent’s situation.
