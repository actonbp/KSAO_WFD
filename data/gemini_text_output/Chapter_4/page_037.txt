CHAPTER 4: Evidence-based Screening 189

Some risk assessment tools are structured instruments designed to predict an outcome of a specific population
over a particular period. These tools, based on past risk factors, do not consider current situations or
context. Other tools use structured professional judgment are created by identifying risk factors coupled with
observations on the part of the professional. These allow for professional judgment when making decisions
regarding violence risk – which research has recommended as the preferred approach.⁸⁰, ⁸¹

**INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE**

The second type of risk assessment is for **intimate partner violence (IPV).** IPV is a pervasive issue that involves
physical, sexual, psychological harm, or threats of such harm between intimate partners. This form of violence
can occur among heterosexual or same-sex couples and does not require sexual intimacy. The perpetrators of
IPV can be both men and women, although women are more frequently the victims. It is estimated that 41% of
female-identifying individuals and 26% of male-identifying individuals experience IPV at some point during
their lives.⁸² IPV is a complex phenomenon that is influenced by multiple factors, including societal, relational,
and individual aspects. Among the individual factors, problematic substance use is notably linked to IPV, both as
a risk factor for perpetration and as a consequence of victimization.⁸³

Routine screening in populations without signs or symptoms of abuse could identify abuse not otherwise known,
prevent future abuse from occurring, and reduce morbidity and mortality. Because of fear, intimidation, and
lack of support, many individuals do not disclose abuse unless directly questioned, and many who are directly
questioned will not disclose. Many screening questionnaires are available that could be used in behavioral
health and primary care settings: ⁸⁴

» **Humiliation, Afraid, Rape, Kick (HARK).** The HARK screening tool is a brief instrument designed to
identify victims of IPV by asking about specific forms of abuse: humiliation, fear, rape, and physical
violence. It is concise and allows healthcare providers to quickly assess for IPV without extensive training.
The HARK has been validated in various settings, showing effectiveness in identifying individuals
experiencing IPV.

» **Hurt/Insult/Threaten/Scream (HITS).** The HITS instrument is a simple, yet effective tool for screening
individuals for IPV. It consists of four questions that ask respondents how often their partner hurts,
insults, threatens, and screams at them. Scores are totaled to indicate the presence of IPV, with higher
scores suggesting greater severity of abuse. HITS is known for its ease of use.

» **Woman Abuse Screening Tool (WAST).** The WAST is designed to identify women experiencing IPV,
focusing on both physical and emotional abuse. It comprises eight questions that explore the dynamics
of the respondent’s relationship, specifically looking at feelings of tension, arguments, and physical
harm. WAST is notable for its ability to capture the nuance of abusive relationships, providing healthcare
providers with a comprehensive view of the respondent’s situation.

» **Abuse Assessment Screen (AAS).** The AAS is a widely used screening instrument specifically designed
to identify cases of IPV and abuse. It consists of a series of questions that inquire about physical, sexual,
and emotional abuse, both currently and in the past year. The AAS has been validated across diverse
populations and settings, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying victims of IPV.

» **Conflict Tactics Scales (CTS2).** The revised Conflict Tactics Scales (CTS2) measure the extent and
severity of partner violence, including psychological aggression and physical assault. The scales have
been used on participants from diverse cultural backgrounds, including African Americans and Hispanic
Americans, in over 20 different countries and they have been translated into at least 15 different
languages.⁸⁵
