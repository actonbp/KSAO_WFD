CHAPTER 4: Evidence-based Screening 199

**Substance Use Disorder Diagnosis**

DSM-5-TR criteria are used by health care professionals to assess whether an individual's substance use is problematic and constitutes a disorder. Although many SUD counselors are not credentialed to provide formal diagnoses, it is important that they know the standards by which such diagnoses are made. Substance-related disorders are categorized into ten classes based on use of the following substances: alcohol, caffeine, cannabis, hallucinogens, inhalants, opioids, sedatives, hypnotics and anxiolytics, stimulants, tobacco, and other (or unknown) substances. These SUDs span a wide variety of problems arising from substance use and cover a total of 11 different criteria (categorized in four domains):¹⁰⁸

**1. Impaired Control:**
    *   Using the substance in larger amounts or over a longer period than was originally intended.
    *   Persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control substance use.
    *   Spending a great deal of time in activities necessary to obtain, use, or recover from the substance's effects.
    *   Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the substance.

**2. Social Impairment:**
    *   Recurrent substance use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations at work, school, or home.
    *   Continued substance use despite having persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of the substance.
    *   Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or reduced because of substance use.

**3. Risky Use:**
    *   Recurrent substance use in situations in which it is physically hazardous.
    *   Substance use is continued despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or exacerbated by the substance.

**4. Pharmacological Criteria:**
    *   Tolerance, as defined by either a need for markedly increased amounts of the substance to achieve intoxication or desired effect, or a markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of the substance.
    *   Withdrawal, as manifested by either the characteristic withdrawal syndrome for the substance or the substance (or a closely related substance) is taken to relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms.

Anyone meeting any two of the 11 criteria during the same 12-month period would receive a diagnosis of a SUD. The severity of the substance use disorder is then determined based on the number of criteria met:
    *   Mild: 2–3 criteria
    *   Moderate: 4–5 criteria
    *   Severe: 6 or more criteria

Clinicians can also add “in early remission,” “in sustained remission,” “on maintenance therapy,” and “in a controlled environment.”
