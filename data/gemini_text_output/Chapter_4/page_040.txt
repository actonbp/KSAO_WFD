**Widely Used Evidence-based Suicide Screening & Assessment Tools**

**Ask Suicide-Screening Questions (ASQ)** from the National Institute of Mental Health

The ASQ toolkit was developed and validated by a team from the National Institute for Mental Health (NIMH). ASQ is a four-item suicide-screening tool designed to be used for people of all ages in emergency departments, inpatient units, and primary care facilities. A Brief Suicide Safety Assessment (BSSA) is available to be used when patients screen positive for suicide risk on the ASQ.

The toolkit is organized by the medical setting in which it will be used: emergency department, inpatient medical/surgical unit, and outpatient primary care and specialty clinics. The ASQ is free of charge and available in multiple languages. All toolkit materials are available on the NIMH website at https://www.nimh. nih.gov/research/research-conducted-at-nimh/asq-toolkit-materials.

**Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) - Triage version**

The Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) evidence-supported screening tool was developed by Columbia University, the University of Pennsylvania, and the University of Pittsburgh supported by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). The C-SSRS Triage version features questions that help determine whether an individual is at risk of suicide. There are brief versions of the C-SSRS often used as a screening tool (first two questions) that, based on patient response, can lead to the administration of the additional questions to triage patients. The protocol and the training on how to use it are available free of charge at https://cssrs.columbia.edu/.

The last question of the PHQ-9 screens for the presence and duration of suicide ideation. It is available in Spanish and other languages and has also been modified for the adolescent population.
