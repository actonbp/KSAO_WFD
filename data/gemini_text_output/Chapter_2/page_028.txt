15. **Provide Hope—Recovery Is Possible**
Providing hope involves projecting an attitude that recovery is possible. This attitude also involves viewing clients as competent to make changes that will allow them to deal with trauma-related challenges, providing opportunities for them to practice dealing with difficult situations, and normalizing discomfort or difficult emotions and framing these as manageable rather than dangerous. When this is conveyed consistently, they will begin to understand that discomfort is not a signal to avoid, but a sign to engage—and that behavioral, cognitive, and emotional responses to cues associated with previous traumas are a normal part of the recovery process.

16. **Develop Strategies to Address Secondary Trauma and Promote Self-Care**
Secondary trauma refers to the trauma that behavioral health service and other providers may experience through exposure to their clients’ traumatic experiences. Working with survivors of trauma may cause additional trauma-related symptoms for counselors. Counselors can reduce the risk of secondary trauma by monitoring their own mental health needs, seeking assistance from behavioral health service providers, and engaging in self-care activities.

**SECONDARY TRAUMA AND BURNOUT**

Secondary trauma is a normal occupational hazard for SUD and mental health professionals, particularly those who serve populations that are likely to include survivors of trauma. The demands of providing care to trauma survivors can**not** be ignored. Counselors face significant challenges, including secondary traumatic stress (STS), burnout, and the need for self-care. To help avoid secondary trauma, counselors must be aware of the risks and symptoms. Their symptoms may include physical or psychological reactions to traumatic memories that clients have shared; avoidance behaviors during client interactions or when recalling emotional content in supervision; numbness, limited emotional expression, or diminished affect; somatic complaints; heightened arousal, including insomnia; negative thinking or depressed mood; and detachment from family, friends, and others.100 Over time, secondary traumatic stress can lead to **vicarious traumatization**, the cumulative effect on the clinician after consistent exposure to other people’s traumatic experiences.

One component of secondary trauma is **burnout**, which is associated with too much work and not enough resources to do that work well. Burnout can result in depression and anxiety, physical and emotional exhaustion, and less enjoyment of work. Planning for coping with secondary trauma and preventing burnout is crucial. To promote self-care, SUD counselors should engage in practices that prevent the emotional exhaustion and depersonalization associated with burnout and STS. These practices may include103, 104
