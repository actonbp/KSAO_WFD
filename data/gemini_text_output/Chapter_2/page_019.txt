CHAPTER 2: Systems of Care 55

**SYSTEM APPROACHES**

**Harm Reduction⁵²**

Harm reduction is an evidence-based, proactive approach designed to reduce the negative impacts of problematic substance use.⁵³ It’s focused on meeting people “where they are” and on their own terms,⁵⁴ and includes compassionate and practical strategies that aim to minimize harm related to problematic substance use. The goal of harm reduction is to enhance quality of life without requiring or advising abstinence or reduction of use. According to SAMHSA, harm reduction is a practical and transformative approach that incorporates community-driven public health strategies—including prevention, risk reduction, and health promotion—to empower people who use drugs.

Harm reduction is a set of services, an approach, and a type of organization. Harm reduction has, at times, been reduced to a singular service or group of services, when in fact, its application goes well beyond this. Harm reduction as an approach — with supporting **principles** and **pillars** that can be applied to a variety of contexts — includes the provision of evidence-based treatment.⁵⁵

Within this framework, harm reduction is designed to encourage positive change and reduce the negative health-related consequences of risky behavior that may be associated with substance use.⁵⁶ It is based on the premise that all people inherently deserve services that promote health, regardless of whether they have problematic substance use.⁵⁷ Given that each person in recovery has their own recovery goals (which may or may not include abstinence from substances), harm reduction activities can encourage outcomes that help prevent overdose and infectious disease transmission for people who have problematic substance use.⁵⁸

Harm reduction strategies are also highly effective in supporting safer substance use behaviors. For example, syringe services programs have limited the sharing of syringes, decreased HIV infection rates, and resulted in fewer overdose deaths.⁵⁹ Harm reduction strategies for opioid use disorder (OUD) have reduced the spread of infectious diseases, resulted in fewer opioid overdoses, and improved retention in and access to care.⁶⁰

Harm reduction strategies include conducting overdose education and naloxone distribution to reduce the risk of opioid overdose; offering test strips to check drugs for fentanyl and xylazine and support safer use; and supporting activities of daily living, including providing services to help people who are using substances obtain food, take showers, or connect
