How a person experiences these events determines whether it is considered\ntraumatic. The long-lasting adverse effects of an event can occur immediately or be delayed. Thus, individual\ntrauma is a result of an event or series of events that is physically or emotionally harmful, or life threatening,\nand that has lasting adverse effects on a person’s mental, physical, social, emotional, or spiritual well-being.78\nTrauma that affects communities, known as community trauma, includes a range of violence and atrocities\nthat erode the sense of safety within a given community.
