Another collaboration is a SAMHSA operated technical assistance center – the **Service Members, Veterans, and**
**their Families Technical Assistance (SMVF TA) Center**. This federal center works to bring federal, state, and
community partners together to close military and civilian gaps and strengthen behavioral health services for
military and veteran families. Focus areas of interagency collaboration include: 1) strengthening infrastructure;
2) improving behavioral health policies for service members, veterans, and their families; 3) implementing
behavioral health best practices; and 4) building sustainability. The SMVF TA Center has a joint military and
civilian interagency Partners Group comprised of leaders from various national organizations and federal
agencies. The Partners Group works to align agency efforts and help advance federal and state collaboration on
issues of interest to service members, veterans, and thei families.

States and territories that participate in SAMHSA’s *SMVF Policy Academy* build teams comprised of both civilian
and military leaders who have the ability and authority to influence and implement state-level policy changes.
These interagency teams work to develop and implement a strategic plan for enhancing behavioral health
systems serving active members of the military, veterans, and their families.
