CHAPTER 2: Systems of Care                                                                                                          57

**Syringe Services Programs** - Access to clean needles and syringes helps to ensure PWID are at reduced risk of
contracting HIV, viral hepatitis, or other bloodborne infections. More than three decades of research supports
the use of syringe services as safe, cost-effective, and life-saving programs for people who have problematic
substance use.⁶⁶

Most community-based syringe services programs provide access to sterile needles, syringes, and other injection
equipment; facilitate safe disposal of used syringes; and offer a range of other services, including:⁶⁷, ⁶⁸
    »    Referrals to SUD treatment programs
    »    Screening, care, and treatment to prevent HIV, STIs, and viral hepatitis
    »    Sexual health programming, including counseling and condom distribution
    »    Education about overdose prevention and safer injection practices
    »    Vaccinations
    »    Overdose education and naloxone distribution
    »    Referral to a range of other services

**Naloxone and Overdose Education Kits**
- Naloxone, a medication that can rapidly
reverse an opioid overdose, is an essential
harm reduction tool for people who have
problematic opioid use. Naloxone attaches
to opioid receptors and reverses and blocks
the effects of opioids. The medication,
which is now available over the counter as
a nasal spray as well as by prescription,
can quickly restore normal breathing to
a person if their breathing has slowed or
stopped because of an opioid overdose.⁶⁹

SAMHSA recommends that every client
who has problematic opioid use or
OUD receive opioid overdose prevention education and naloxone.⁷⁰ Naloxone is generally not harmful. In the
event of an ongoing overdose, the risk of death associated with opioid overdose is far greater than the risk of
experiencing adverse effects from naloxone administration. **Chapter 6 in this study guide provides more detailed
information about the use of Naloxone.**

**Fentanyl and Xylazine Test Strips** - The use of fentanyl has been associated with a significant increase in
overdose and death rates.⁷¹ Fentanyl is a powerful synthetic opioid that is 50 times stronger than heroin and 100
times stronger than morphine.⁷² Although pharmaceutically produced fentanyl is prescribed to treat pain, illicitly
manufactured fentanyl may be added to other substances, making those drugs more powerful and addictive. It is
also difficult to tell whether a substance contains fentanyl, making the substance more dangerous.⁷³

Fentanyl test strips, which can now be purchased with federal funding, can detect the presence of fentanyl
within 5 minutes. They are an essential harm reduction tool for reducing overdose and deaths related to this
substance.⁷⁴ Counselors can learn how to access and use fentanyl test strips through local syringe services
programs. The North America Syringe Exchange Network's website has a map with links for locating many of
these programs in their communities.⁷⁵
