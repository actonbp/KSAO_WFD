Both ambulatory and inpatient detoxification have their roles in the continuum of care for SUD, with the choice
of setting depending on individual client needs and circumstances. The primary goal in both approaches is to
safely manage withdrawal symptoms, initiate the recovery process, and facilitate transition to ongoing SUD
treatment.

**Outpatient Programs**

Outpatient treatment programs encompass a range of services and therapies which are delivered in a variety
of settings, such as clinics, counseling centers, hospitals, or community health facilities. Outpatient treatment
varies in the types and intensity of services offered. Treatment services typically include individual, group, and
family counseling. Services can range from weekly counseling to intensive counseling provided several times a
week.
» Outpatient treatment is appropriate for individuals whose substance use patterns allow them to remain in
their own homes and environments while receiving services. These programs serve a diverse population
of individuals with problematic substance use, including those who:
    » Do not require 24-hour supervision or medical detoxification.
    » Are transitioning from inpatient or residential treatment to a less intensive level of care.
    » Are seeking flexibility to attend treatment while managing work, school, or family responsibilities.
    » Have a strong support system at home or in the community who can benefit from outpatient services.
    » Have completed detoxification and stabilization are ready for ongoing recovery support and relapse
    prevention strategies.
    » Have co-occurring mental health disorders who require integrated treatment for both conditions.

There are levels of intensity within the outpatient program category. Intensive outpatient programs and partial
hospitalization programs provide structured treatment for SUDs, but the key difference lies in the intensity and
type of care.
» **Intensive Outpatient Programs (IOPs)** are ambulatory services for individuals with SUDs who do not meet
diagnostic criteria for residential or inpatient treatment or for those who are discharged from 24-hour
care in an inpatient treatment facility and continue to need more support than the weekly or bi-weekly
sessions provided in traditional outpatient care. IOP services offer a minimum of 9 hours of service per
week in three, 3-hour sessions; however, some programs provide more sessions per week and/or longer
sessions per day, and many programs become less intensive over time. Because services are provided in
outpatient settings, the duration may be longer than that required for inpatient services. IOPs provide
structured individual, group, or family counseling as well as psychoeducation about substance use and
mental health disorders. IOPs allow clients to remain in their own homes and communities, which may
improve their adjustment to community life.¹⁸ Service settings are usually community-based public and
private substance use treatment centers or hospital-based inpatient and day treatment; however, online
synchronous IOP programming and telehealth appointments have steadily evolved to bolster existing
services and meet the needs of individuals living in rural areas.¹⁹
» **Partial Hospitalization Programs (PHP)** offer a more intensive level of care than IOPs, usually providing
treatment services during the day for several hours, five to seven days a week. Clients return home
at night. PHPs serve as an intermediate step between inpatient care and IOPs, providing medical
monitoring, psychiatric stabilization, and intensive therapy. They are suitable for clients who require
more comprehensive medical and psychiatric attention but do not need 24-hour hospitalization.
PHPs can include medical supervision, medication management, individual and group therapy, and
other therapeutic activities. They are often used as a step-down from inpatient care or to prevent
hospitalization for clients whose condition can be managed with intensive day treatment.²⁰
