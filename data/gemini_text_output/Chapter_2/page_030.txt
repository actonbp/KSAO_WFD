mutual aid, disseminating health information
more effectively, and reducing the impact
of mental stress. Conversely, experiencing
interactions involving racism or discrimination
can negatively affect health.¹¹¹ Strong social ties
and support networks can act as a protective
factor against substance use disorders. Isolation
and lack of social support, on the other hand,
can increase the risk of substance use and
hinder recovery efforts. In addition, exposure
to socially toxic environments (violence,
poverty, and economic stressors) may increase
vulnerability to problematic substance use.¹¹²

4. **Economic stability:** A close link exists between
access to financial resources and health and
well-being. People living in poverty or with
financial instability have poorer health. Without
access to income, people may be more likely
to forgo needed healthcare or be unable to
pay for food or housing. Poverty and low
socioeconomic status are linked to higher rates
of problematic substance use, as individuals in
these situations may experience higher levels of
stress, limited access to healthcare, and greater exposure to drug-using environments.¹¹³

5. **Neighborhood and built environment:** Neighborhood and the built environment encompasses safety,
housing quality, access to transportation and healthy food, and environmental conditions, such as water
and air quality. These factors can directly affect health. Where someone lives matters when it comes to
problematic substance use. For example, researchers have established links between drug overdose and
a deteriorating urban built environment with such characteristics as dilapidated or burned buildings,
vandalized public property, and unclean streets.¹¹⁴
