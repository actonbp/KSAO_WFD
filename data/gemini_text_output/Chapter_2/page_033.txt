CHAPTER 2: Systems of Care 69

**Patient-Centered Medical Homes (PCMH).** The PCMH model emphasizes comprehensive, continuous, and
integrated healthcare services. In a PCMH, primary care providers, behavioral health professionals, and other
healthcare staff work collaboratively in a coordinated approach to manage all aspects of patient care. This model
is designed to improve access to healthcare, enhance the patient experience, increase care coordination, and
improve health outcomes by integrating behavioral health with primary care.

**Training and Workforce Development.** Initiatives aimed at training primary care providers in recognizing
and managing behavioral health issues are essential for integration. This includes providing primary care
professionals with resources and training in behavioral health screening, brief interventions, and referral to
specialized care when needed. Additionally, there are special federal workforce initiatives like loan repayment
programs, scholarships, and training grants helps to meet the growing demand for integrated care services.

**Policy and Reimbursement Changes.** Federal and state policies are increasingly supporting the integration
of primary care and behavioral health. This includes changes in reimbursement policies to fund integrated
care models, such as bundled payments or value-based care arrangements that incentivize holistic and
patient-centered care approaches. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), for instance, has provisions that support the
integration of behavioral health into primary care settings, reflecting a systemic shift towards comprehensive
and coordinated healthcare services. The Drug Addiction Treatment Act (DATA) of 2000 marked a pivotal
change in the approach to opioid addiction treatment, moving towards a more medicalized and less centralized
treatment model for opioid use disorders. Expanded funding at the federal level has supported integration, such
as the Substance Abuse Service Expansion (SASE) and the Access Increases in Mental Health and Substance
Abuse Services (AIMS) which were initiatives designed to enhance SUD and mental health services at HRSA-
funded health centers.¹²³ Other recent funding initiatives have been targeted at the opioid crisis (e.g., State
Opioid Response (SOR, STOR) grants, Tribal Opioid Response grants, State Pilot Grant Program for Treatment for
Pregnant and Postpartum Women).

**Targeted Programs for Special Populations.** Recognizing the unique needs of specific populations, such as
pregnant women, children, adolescents, the elderly, and veterans, some initiatives focus on integrating care
tailored to these groups. For example, programs targeting children and adolescents may integrate pediatric care
with child and adolescent psychiatry and psychology, while initiatives for veterans might combine primary care
with specialized behavioral health services addressing PTSD and other service-related health issues.

**Criminal Justice System**¹²⁴

Arrest and incarceration of people with SUDs has had severe
consequences for individuals, their families and communities,
and society. Attaching criminal penalties to substance use
alone has contributed to lost lives, hope and opportunity.
Untreated SUD is overrepresented in the prison and jail
populations. It is estimated that 63% of people in jail and
58% in prison have an SUD.¹²⁵ The impact begins at arrest and
continues through incarceration, after release, and during
reentry to communities. Arrest and incarceration for crimes
related to substance use and possession disproportionately
impact Black, indigenous, and other historically marginalized
communities. In fact, Black persons are nearly five times
more likely to be incarcerated for drug possession than
White persons. Additional data shows Black Americans are
incarcerated at 4.8 times the rate of White Americans, and
Latinx individuals are incarcerated at a rate of 1.3 times the
rate of White non-Latinx.¹²⁶ Among other racial groups, recent
data for federal prisons show that Asians represent 1.5% of
their incarcerated population and Native Americans represent
2.8%.¹²⁷
