CHAPTER 2: Systems of Care 67

SYSTEMS INTEGRATION

The integration of health, behavioral health, and human service systems
is a pivotal strategy for addressing and reducing the **health disparities**
that stem from social, economic, and environmental disadvantages.
These preventable disparities result in unequal health outcomes, service
accessibility issues, and differences in the quality of care received by
various population groups. Integration also provides a method for
achieving **health equity** which is a continual process of ensuring that
all individuals or populations have optimal opportunities to attain the
best health possible.¹¹⁵ Applying the principle of health equity requires
that barriers to promoting good health are removed and resources are
allocated among populations and/or communities proportional to their
need(s). Systems integration not only enhances the reach and effectiveness of services but also ensures that
interventions are culturally relevant and sensitive to the unique needs of diverse communities.

Integrating systems of care for individuals with SUDs has substantial benefits. These individuals often have
co-occurring mental health and physical health conditions. Integrated care ensures all conditions are treated
simultaneously, promoting a more holistic approach to healthcare. The evidence strongly suggests that people
of all ages living with these co-occurring conditions have higher health costs yet experience poorer health
outcomes. They, and their families, are faced with significant inequities based on racial, ethnic, and economic
challenges and can benefit from evidence-based integrated interventions in whatever setting they are best
engaged. Integrated care models are often more cost-effective, preventing conditions from worsening and
reducing the need for intensive treatments later. Integration also enhances accessibility, reducing the need for
clients to navigate multiple healthcare providers by offering a streamlined service that addresses all their health
needs in one place.¹¹⁷

Primary Care

Integrating SUD services with primary health care is a strategic approach
to improving access to treatment for the 39.7 million adults and 1.8
million adolescents in the U.S. who currently do not seek or receive
necessary SUD treatment. Nearly 95% of those not receiving treatment
didn’t believe they needed help—but for 1.8 million adults who thought
they did, barriers to treatment left them unwilling or unable to get
support.¹¹⁸ Integrated care is vital for expanding access to behavioral
health services. There are many barriers to accessing specialty substance
use and mental health services such as provider shortages,¹¹⁹ high out-
of-pocket costs, and gaps in insurance coverage. In addition, providing
these specialty treatment services in primary healthcare settings can
help reduce the stigma associated with these conditions, normalizing
them as part of overall health care and encouraging more people to seek
help.

Models for integrating primary care with behavioral health are diverse,
involving collaborative care models, enhanced use of health IT, adoption
of the PCMH model, focused training and workforce development,
supportive policy changes, and specialized programs for different
populations. There is a continuum of various levels of integration.¹²⁰

**Health disparities** are preventable
differences in the burden of disease,
injury, violence, or opportunities
to achieve optimal health that are
experienced by socially disadvantaged
populations.¹¹⁶

**Integratedness** is the degree to
which programs or practices are
organized to deliver integrated
physical and behavioral health
prevention and treatment services.

Integratedness is also a measure
of development of both structural
components (e.g., staffing) and
care processes (e.g., screening)
that support the extent to which
“integrated services” in these
settings are directly experienced
by people served and delivered by
service providers.¹²¹
