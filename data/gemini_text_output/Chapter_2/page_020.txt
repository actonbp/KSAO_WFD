with housing. These activities have been found to reduce the risk of injury, illness, and death associated with
substance use.⁶¹ According to SAMHSA, harm reduction services can:⁶²

» Connect individuals to overdose education, counseling, and referral to treatment for infectious diseases
and substance use disorders.

» Distribute opioid overdose reversal medications (i.e., naloxone) to individuals at risk of overdose or to
those who might respond to an overdose.

» Lessen harms associated with drug use and related behaviors, such as high-risk sexual activity. Such
behaviors may increase the risk of infectious diseases, including HIV, sexually transmitted infections,
viral hepatitis, and bacterial and fungal infections.

» Reduce infectious disease transmission among people who use drugs, including those who inject drugs, by
equipping them with accurate information and facilitating referral to resources.

» Reduce overdose deaths, promote linkages to care, and facilitate colocation of services as part of a
comprehensive, integrated approach.

» Reduce stigma associated with substance use and co-occurring disorders.

» Promote a philosophy of hope and healing by incorporating people with lived experience of recovery in the
management of harm reduction services, and connecting service recipients who have expressed interest to
treatment, peer support workers, and other recovery support services.

» Build community and increase protective factors – for people who use drugs and their families.

SAMHSA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have joined together for the National Harm
Reduction Technical Assistance Center to provide free help to anyone in the country providing (or planning
to provide) harm reduction services to their community. This may include syringe services programs, health
departments, programs providing treatment for substance use disorder, as well as prevention and recovery
programs.

**HARM REDUCTION METHODS**

Several evidence-based harm reduction methods are available to support recovery from problematic substance
use. Here are four examples of widely used harm reduction methods. Each intervention includes information for
SUD counselors who want to connect people in recovery with related resources in their community.

**Safer Injection Practices** - People who inject drugs (PWID) are at higher risk of disease transmission, including
HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV), as well as damage to their veins and other potentially serious soft tissue
infections.⁶³ PWID may also be more likely to engage in high-risk sexual behaviors, such as unprotected sex,
which may put them at higher risk of other sexually transmitted infections (STIs).⁶⁴ Harm reduction practices
that educate people about safer injection practices and offer clean supplies are essential for reducing exposure to
infections and supporting safety with continued use.

Counselors can access many harm reduction resources to share information with PWID about the importance of
ensuring they have access to clean water and supplies; performing handwashing, basic hygiene, and wound care;
and understanding other methods for reducing infection. Key areas to discuss include:⁶⁵

» Cleaning hands and skin prior to injections.
» Using sterile equipment prior to each injection (the next section discusses syringe services programs).
» Cleaning used syringes with bleach if new syringes are not available.
» Understanding how to find and care for veins.
» Practicing appropriate hygiene to prevent infections following an injection.
