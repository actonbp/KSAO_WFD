**INTRODUCTION**

According to the 2022 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), 36.8 million people living in the United States who need substance use disorder (SUD) treatment did not seek it or did they think they should get it.¹ The data for adolescents, is likewise alarming – among the 1.8 million adolescents (aged 12 to 17) who had an SUD in the past year, 97.5% (or 1.7 million people) did not seek treatment or think that they should get it.² Most people with SUD face prejudice, stigma, and discrimination, and this may be especially true for sub-groups of particularly vulnerable individuals seeking treatment (e.g. racial/ethnic, sexual minority, justice-involved, and others). The stigma surrounding individuals who have SUDs is a pervasive phenomenon that has had detrimental effects on treatment outcomes, healthcare providers, treatments, research, policies, and society as a whole.³ Consequences of such stigma include avoidance of medical and substance use services, decreased retention in treatment, and increased substance use.⁴ The 2022 National Drug Control Strategy emphasizes the importance of having a comprehensive SUD system of care that meets individuals where they are, offering essential services that save lives, enhance health, and provide a full range of prevention, treatment, and recovery support.⁵

This chapter examines the many issues surrounding the provision care for individuals with SUDs, highlighting the need for integrated care systems that also include services for co-occurring mental health and physical health conditions. The chapter addresses the evolution of the SUD treatment service system which has shifted to include more integrated and holistic approaches. These changes are partly in response to the opioid crisis, advancements in telehealth, and a growing recognition of the interconnectedness of substance use, mental health, and physical health. It explores the traditional system of care for SUD with an expanded focus on current harm reduction strategies, and the intersection of the behavioral health systems with primary healthcare, the criminal justice system, and child welfare.
