CHAPTER 2: Systems of Care 65

» **Education and Training:** Continuing education on topics related to trauma, burnout, and self-care can provide counselors with additional strategies and tools for managing their stress and emotional health.

» **Mindfulness and Meditation:** Practices such as mindfulness, meditation, and yoga can help reduce stress, increase emotional regulation, and improve overall well-being.

» **Physical Self-Care:** Regular exercise, adequate sleep, and nutritious eating can help maintain physical health and resilience against stress.

» **Setting Boundaries:** Establishing clear boundaries between work and personal life, including managing work hours and caseloads, can help prevent burnout.

» **Peer Support:** Building a network of supportive colleagues can provide a space for sharing experiences and coping strategies, reducing feelings of isolation.

» **Creative Outlets:** Engaging in creative activities outside of work, like art, music, or writing, can provide emotional release and rejuvenation.

» **Nature and Leisure Time:** Spending time in nature and engaging in leisure activities can be restorative and help counselors disconnect from work stress.

» **Professional Development:** Pursuing interests and goals outside of the direct counseling role, such as teaching, research, or advocacy, can provide a sense of growth and accomplishment.

» **Self-Reflection:** Regular self-reflection on the impact of work can help counselors recognize early signs of burnout or secondary trauma and take proactive steps to address them.

Implementing these strategies consistently can help counselors manage the emotional demands of their work and maintain their own mental health and well-being.

**Social Determinants of Health**

Social determinants of health (SDOH) refer to the conditions in the environments where people are born, live, learn, work, play, worship, and age that affect a wide range of health, functioning, and quality-of-life outcomes and risks. The relationship between SDOH and health outcomes is complex and interdependent, with each determinant potentially affecting health directly and indirectly. Counselors need to recognize and understand the connection between SDOH and problematic substance use to fully support clients in their recovery journey.¹⁰⁵

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion and Healthy People 2030 groups SDOH into the following five domains.¹⁰⁶, ¹⁰⁷

1.  **Healthcare access and quality:** People lacking access to healthcare may be unable to receive the care they need and may forgo needed preventive care or treatment for illnesses. Limited access to healthcare services can prevent individuals from receiving early intervention and treatment for substance use disorders, leading to more severe and chronic conditions over time.¹⁰⁸

2.  **Education access and quality:** People with higher levels of education are more likely to live healthier lives because of their ability to obtain safe, high-paying jobs. People with less education and poorer quality of education have fewer employment opportunities and are more likely to face health problems, such as heart disease, diabetes, and depression.¹⁰⁹ Lower educational attainment is associated with an increased risk of substance use and SUDs.¹¹⁰ Education can provide knowledge about the risks of substance use, as well as opportunities for economic stability that can reduce vulnerability to substance abuse.

3.  **Social and community context:** Relationships and interactions with family and friends and strong ties with the community are important. The level of connectedness and trust among members of a community helps to create strong social networks that can improve health outcomes by promoting
