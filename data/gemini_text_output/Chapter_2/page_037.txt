CHAPTER 2: Systems of Care                                                                                                  73

Children in foster care often have difficult relationships with their caregivers due to histories of maltreatment and frequent placement changes. These challenges can lead to feelings of instability, isolation, and a lack of emotional support, increasing the risk of turning to substance use as a coping mechanism.143 The **California Evidence-based Clearinghouse for Child Welfare** has an extensive searchable database for prevention and early intervention programs that have been found effective for parents and children in the child welfare system.

**Collaborative Care Models.** Collaborative practice is a systems-change approach that considers both systems-level policy efforts as well as practice-level strategies to improve family recovery, safety, stability, and well-being. Collaboration between agencies improves service delivery and the experiences of children and families who deal with multiple organizations. Collaborative care models involve coordination between child welfare services, SUD treatment providers, mental health professionals, and other social services. These models aim to create a more holistic approach to family care, ensuring that families receive comprehensive services tailored to their specific needs. Collaboration can lead to more effective case management and support for families, helping to navigate the complexities of both the child welfare and healthcare systems. There are two prevailing models: **Casey Family Programs Practice Model** and the **Collaborative Practice Model**144 from Children and Family Futures.

**Problem-Solving Courts.** A variety of court structures are available, such as drug and mental health courts. The **Family Treatment Court (FTC)** is considered a problem-solving court that handles cases of child maltreatment in which parental substance use is a contributing factor. Child protective services, treatment professionals, court personnel, and community partners coordinate services with the goals of ensuring that children have safe, nurturing, and permanent homes; parents achieve stable recovery; and each family member receives the services and supports needed. FTCs have proven to support positive outcomes for families affected by parental substance use disorder, including improved recovery for adults, safety for children, and timely permanency for families.145

**Specialized Programs for Pregnant Women and Parents.** When a potential SUD is identified in the prenatal or postpartum period, the mother must be referred for a comprehensive assessment and, if indicated, engaged in quality treatment services that are culturally responsive, trauma-informed, and family-centered. States using funding from the HHS Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant must prioritize pregnant women for SUD treatment services and provide access to treatment or interim services within 48 hours.

Specialized treatment programs for pregnant women with SUDs and mental health conditions focus on providing care that addresses the unique needs of this population. These programs often include comprehensive services such as obstetric care, substance use treatment, mental health counseling, and support for parenting and child development. By addressing the specific needs of pregnant women and parents, these programs work to improve health outcomes for both mothers and their children and reduce the likelihood of negative child welfare outcomes. Here are several examples:146

Â»   The Maternal Opioid Misuse (MOM) Model focuses on pregnant and postpartum women with opioid use disorders. MOM provides coordinated service delivery in which individuals receive a variety of services, including specialized medication-assisted treatment, intensive case management, individual and group counseling, and recovery supports.
