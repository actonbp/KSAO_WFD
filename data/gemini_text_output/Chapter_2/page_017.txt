CHAPTER 2: Systems of Care 53

**Mutual-Help Groups**

**Mutual-help groups**—also known as mutual-aid, mutual-support or self-help—groups—are groups of two or
more people who share an experience or condition, and who come together to provide condition-specific help
and support to one another. Members themselves run groups without professional involvement. And, unlike
professional interventions, people can attend mutual-help groups as intensively and for as long as they desire,
without insurance approval or divulgence of personally identifying information.

The most popular type of mutual-help group is based on the Twelve Steps of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). AA and
other **12-Step programs** are based on a set of guiding principles outlining a course of action for recovery from
problematic substance use or other behavioral problems. 12-Step programs focus on three key ideas:

1. Acceptance or the realization that substance use disorder is a chronic, progressive disease over which one
   has no control, that willpower alone is insufficient to overcome the problem, and that abstinence is the
   goal.

2. Surrendering or giving oneself over to a higher power, accepting the fellowship and support structure of
   other individuals in recovery, and following the recovery activities laid out by the 12-Step program.

3. Active involvement in 12-Step meetings and related activities.
