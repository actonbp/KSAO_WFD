CHAPTER 2: Systems of Care                                                                                                    49

healthcare services more convenient for patients/clients, especially those in rural areas, those with small
children (childcare) and those with mobility restrictions.³⁷ A 2017 review of the literature on telehealth found
many benefits for both service recipients and service providers, such as: its ease of use; decreased travel time;
improvements in outcomes and communication; and its low cost. Telehealth can also provide a high-quality
service, increase access to care, and empower patients/clients to manage their chronic conditions. For healthcare
organizations, telehealth decreases missed appointments, is a good modality for education, decreases wait times,
decreases readmissions, and improves medication adherence.³⁸

There are also challenges. To engage in telehealth, both the provider and the client need access to a device
(i.e., a computer, tablet, or smartphone) and reliable access to the Internet (cellular or broadband). As of 2019,
most Americans reported owning some type of cell phone, a desktop, or a laptop. Even though many have
access to a suitable device, individuals may confront specific challenges limiting their ability to use telehealth.
For example, the age, usability, and functionality of clients’ devices may limit their ability to be used for
telehealth appointments. Additionally, clients may share devices with others in their home, limiting the types
of information they would want to store or share through the device. For providers, some organizations struggle
to have enough laptops to support staff working from home or outside of
typical shared office space.³⁹

Undoubtedly, telehealth is a tool that facilitates the delivery of treatment
and other health related activities. Technology alone, however, does
not bring about desired outcomes. First and foremost, counselors need
to have a foundation of proficiency in counseling skills and practices.
Second, their **readiness to deliver telehealth services** is critical. This
depends on several key factors including personal motivation and
favorable attitudes about telehealth; level of knowledge about and
use of the chosen telehealth technology; ability to engage the person
seeking services; ability to use clinicals skills and practices in a
virtual environment; and adherence to legal and regulatory standards
that govern scope of practice and protection of client rights. Due to
the changing nature of telehealth, counselors should seek continual
professional development and know current laws and regulations to
ensure positive outcomes for clients and protect themselves. Professional
associations and credentialing bodies have supported the use of
telehealth by updating their practice guidelines to include special issues
surrounding telehealth.⁴⁰, ⁴¹

Service providers face additional obstacles:

»   **Requirement for provider licensure**: Most states require
    behavioral health counselors to be licensed (not certified). Some
    states also require the counselor to be licensed in the state
    where the client is located, which creates a significant barrier
    to widespread implementation of telehealth. Several states, however, have taken actions that reduce
    regulations associated with telehealth, including allowing practitioners (including those out of state)
    not normally authorized to deliver telehealth services to do so and modifying in-person examination
    requirements which are a pre-requisite for telehealth services.⁴²

»   **Unpredictable regulatory environment**. Telehealth regulations and reimbursement requirements are still
    changing.

»   **Privacy concerns**. Patient confidentiality rules, both federal and state, were largely developed before the
    Internet was used for healthcare delivery. Providers need to be vigilant to protect their clients’ privacy
    and guard against data breaches and other threats. Providers should also carefully review mobile apps
    used to support recovery.
