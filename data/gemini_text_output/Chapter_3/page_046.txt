and internalized stigma. Stigma can take many forms, such as discrimination, harassment, family rejection, social rejection, or violence. Minority stress exposures contribute to disturbances in physical health such as metabolism, immune function, cardiovascular health, cognition, and mood. Minority stress is also associated with higher prevalence of unhealthy behaviors, such as tobacco use and binge drinking, and it is a risk factor for causes of mortality that include HIV and suicide.188

Another factor leading to adverse physical and behavioral health consequences is the use of drugs for sexual enhancement among men who have sex with men (MSM)—often called **chemsex**. Drugs most often used in this context are crystal methamphetamine (in particular), mephedrone, GHB/GBL, cocaine, and ketamine.190 While most MSM who engage in chemsex administer drugs non-intravenously, some administer drugs intravenously; this practice is known as **slamsex** or slamming.191 These sexual enhancement practices are linked to high-risk behaviors and increased prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV, especially among HIV-negative MSM.

Among youth, SAMHSA’s 2023 report—*Moving Beyond Change Efforts: Evidence and Action to Support and Affirm LGBTQI+ Youth*192 – provides a comprehensive research overview of treatment and other service best practices and important information on behavioral health concerns within this community of youth. Importantly, it highlights research that stresses how attempts to change an individual’s sexual orientation and gender identity (“conversion therapy”) are harmful and should not be provided. The report documents how LGBTQI+ youth also experience significant physical and behavioral health inequities. Several factors contribute to these inequities and result in minority stress, which is harmful to behavioral health, including: 193, 194, 195

» Stigma
» Negative social attitudes
» Systemic barriers in healthcare
» Rejection and lack of support from families, caregivers, and communities
» Bullying and harassment, and lack of recognition and support in schools

In addition, some youth with diverse sexual orientation and/or gender identity, like adults, are at increased risk for:

» Psychological distress (e.g., depressive symptoms, anxiety, trauma, and behavioral disorders)196
» Substance use
» Suicidal ideation and attempts197, 198
» Victimization, violence, and homelessness
» Involvement with child welfare services, often stemming from family rejection199
» Involvement in juvenile justice programs200

**SERVICE IMPLICATIONS**

When addressing substance use and mental health issues in LGBTQI+ individuals, it’s important to consider a mix of factors including their demographics, gender-related issues, and social challenges. The behavioral health field, in partnership with expert practitioners working with this population, has been systematically updating the standards of care to reflect these complex issues. Research has shown that practice standards need to be stratified according to the gender identity concerns and related experiences across children, adolescents, and adults.201
