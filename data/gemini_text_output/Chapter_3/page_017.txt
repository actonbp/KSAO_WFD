[Image: A close-up, black and white photograph showing a medical vial or test tube with a white label. The label prominently displays the text "TEST - HIV" in large, bold, black capital letters. Below "HIV", there is a barcode-like symbol consisting of several vertical black lines. The vial appears to be held or positioned near a gloved hand or another medical instrument, with a blurred background suggesting other medical supplies or a clinical setting. The overall image has a grainy, high-contrast aesthetic.]

risky sexual behaviors, increasing the likelihood of HIV transmission. Second, specific modes of substance
use, particularly injection drug use, provide a direct pathway for HIV transmission through the sharing of
contaminated needles and other injection equipment. Furthermore, the social environments often associated
with problematic substance use, such as poverty, marginalization, and limited access to healthcare, contribute to
the increased risk of HIV exposure.⁵⁶

The opioid epidemic has been escalating for over a decade in the U.S.
Issues stemming from the opioid epidemic have led to an increased
prevalence of people who inject drugs (PWID), which further contributes
to recent increases in HIV cases. Individuals with HIV/AIDS also
constitute a susceptible group adversely affected by problematic or
long-term opioid use. They are known to suffer from HIV-related pain
and are commonly treated with opioids, leading to subsequent opioid
use disorders.⁵⁷ There has been a noticeable shift in the demographics of
new HIV diagnoses among PWID. An increase in diagnoses is observed
among White individuals, young people aged 13–34, and residents outside
large central metropolitan areas, highlighting a change in the epidemic’s
geography and affected populations.⁵⁸ Despite the availability of multiple
evidence-based interventions to treat opioid use disorder and prevent HIV
acquisition, significant barriers hinder the delivery of these solutions to
many PWID. These include stigma, discriminatory policies, and lack of
comprehensive healthcare access.

Opioid use disorder (OUD) and
infectious diseases are intertwined
epidemics.⁵⁹ In the 1980s, it was
realized that human HIV could be
transmitted via injection drug use.
Today, infectious diseases linked to
OUD include HIV and hepatitis A, B,
and C viruses, as well as bacterial,
fungal, and other infections.

For individuals living with HIV who experience a co-occurring SUD, effective SUD treatment improves both HIV-
and SUD-related health outcomes.⁶⁰ However, people with both HIV and SUDs may delay HIV treatment initiation
and underuse SUD treatment; therefore, personally-tailored and integrated services are necessary to achieve
both HIV- and SUD-related treatment goals. SUD treatment programs need to be well-equipped to provide HIV
risk assessments, testing, counseling, and linkage to HIV care providers. They should also provide PrEP (pre-
exposure prophylaxis) and PEP (post-exposure prophylaxis) prescriptions for those who do not have HIV to
reduce their risk of contracting HIV.

While there are many considerations when treating SUDs among people with HIV, many approaches have been
found effective for addressing these complexities and challenges. Providers should:
