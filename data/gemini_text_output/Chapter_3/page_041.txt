CHAPTER 3: Co-Occurring Conditions and Special Populations 125

**2. Mental Health Issues:** Depression, anxiety, and other MHDs are common among older adults and can
co-occur with SUDs. These conditions may serve as both a cause and a consequence of substance use,
creating a cycle that is difficult to break without integrated treatment approaches.

**3. Lack of Awareness:** Older adults may not realize how much they are drinking or that their substance
use is a problem. For example, a woman in her 70s might think she can safely drink the same amount
of alcohol that she drank in her 30s. This is not necessarily so. Some older adults think the amount of
alcohol they drink is not risky although it exceeds recommendations for low-risk drinking. Sometimes
a client’s lack of awareness can result from cognitive impairment, making it hard for the client to self-
monitor alcohol intake.

**Social Vulnerabilities**

**1. Isolation and Loneliness:** Social isolation and feelings of loneliness are significant issues among older
adults, which can increase the risk of substance use as individuals may turn to alcohol or drugs as a form
of self-soothing. The lack of social support from family members also makes recovery more challenging.
Older adults who are socially connected and feel positive about their social network appear to have better
health and well-being than older people who are not socially well connected.

**2. Bereavement and Life Transitions:** The loss of loved ones and significant life changes such as retirement
or moving to assisted living can trigger or worsen SUDs. These events can lead to increased feelings of
purposelessness or grief, contributing to problematic substance use.

**3. Cultural Norms:** Cultural norms can influence a person’s help-seeking behavior. For example, an older
person whose culture discourages talking about mental health issues or problematic substance use may
not seek help. In some cultures, it is more acceptable to talk about physical symptoms than it is to talk
about symptoms of addiction or feeling depressed or wanting to hurt oneself. This can make it hard for a
healthcare provider to know when a client from this kind of cultural background has a problem related to
an SUD or MHD.

**BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS**

As noted earlier, problematic substance use, including SUDs, among older adults often goes unrecognized and
untreated. Societal norms, values, and biases play a role in this phenomenon. Some people hold the ageist false
belief that SUDs do not exist or need no treatment in this age group. Others—even some healthcare providers—
mistake SUD symptoms for normal age-related changes. Some healthcare providers may focus more on older
adults’ reports of physical/medical complaints. Similarly, some older adults may deny or hide their substance
use-related problems from their healthcare providers. Unfortunately, many would rather avoid the shame,
prejudice, and discrimination associated with problematic substance use and mental health diagnoses. Lack of
treatment for problematic substance use and SUDs can result in more risk of fractures secondary to recurrent
falls, memory loss, sleep disturbances, anxiety, and depression.¹⁶³

In general, the use of alcohol, tobacco, and illicit and non-medical prescription drugs decreases with age¹⁶⁴;
however, recent survey findings raise concern especially for alcohol and prescription opioids, which are the two
most problematically used substances among older adults. While the percentage of older adults who misused
opioids in the last year (1.8%) seems low, it is important to realize this means 1,054,800 individuals. Results
from the 2022 *National Survey on Drug Use and Health* (NSDUH) survey pertaining to individuals 50 and older, and a
narrower breakout of 65 or older, are shown the following data.¹⁶⁵
