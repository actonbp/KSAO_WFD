CHAPTER 3: Co-Occurring Conditions and Special Populations 129

The variability within the LGBTQI+ community
is significant because it includes a wide range of
identities and experiences. Other terms are also used
frequently today, such as non-binary, agender, bigender,
genderqueer, gender fluid, and gender-nonconforming,
refer to people who identify outside the categories of
male or female. People who embrace these identities
may or may not identify as transgender. Some people
also use the terms Two Spirit and queer to describe
gender identity as well as sexual orientation. People
who are not transgender are cisgender (individuals
whose gender identity is congruent with their sex
assigned at birth). Like cisgender people, transgender
people can be of any sexual orientation.¹⁷⁷

**LGBTQI+ AND SUBSTANCE USE AND MENTAL**
**HEALTH CONDITIONS**

Data from the 2022 *National Survey on Drug Abuse and*
*Health*¹⁷⁸ indicates that lesbian, gay, and bisexual (in
particular) adults are more likely than non-LGBTQI+
adults to use substances, have SUDs, and experience
mental health issues, including serious thoughts of
suicide.¹⁷⁹ Fifty-three percent (53%) of LBG adults aged
18 years of older reported illicit drug use in the past
year – as compared to 24.9% of non-LGB adults in the
past year.¹⁸⁰

Consider this additional data that highlights how
sexual minorities experience unique stressors that can
contribute to adverse substance use and mental health
outcomes.

» Experiencing psychological or physical abuse as a result of one’s nonconforming gender expression or
identity is associated with a three- to four-fold higher odds of alcohol, marijuana, or cocaine use, as well
as 8-times higher odds of any drug use, among transgender women.¹⁸¹

» LGBTQ young people are **more than four times as likely** to attempt suicide than their peers, and **41% of LGBTQ+ young people** seriously considered attempting suicide in the past year, including **roughly half of transgender and nonbinary youth**.¹⁸², ¹⁸³

» People who identify as bisexual may experience additional problems with substance use and mental
health due to sexual orientation-based discrimination, bisexual invisibility and erasure, and a lack of
bisexual-affirmative support.¹⁸⁴

» Bias-motivated violence, such as hate crimes based on sexual orientation or gender identity, may have
particularly severe psychological consequences for LGBTQI+ people.¹⁸⁵

Several theories exist regarding the observed differences in substance use and mental health prevalence between
LGBTQI+ and non-LGBTQI+ populations. One is that the increased rates of behavioral health difficulties are
not caused by their identities, but are related to increased stress from discrimination, bullying, violence and
rejection faced more frequently by LGBTQI+ individuals.¹⁸⁶ The Minority Stress Model proposed by Ilan Meyer
is the most widely adopted framework.¹⁸⁷ Meyer asserts that stigma, prejudice, and discrimination create a
hostile and stressful social environment, contributing to internal stressors like low self-esteem, shame, guilt,
