CHAPTER 3: Co-Occurring Conditions and Special Populations 93

» **Collaboration:** The counselor can collaborate and communicate with psychiatrists, primary care physicians or other healthcare professionals to ensure coordinated care and to address any concerns or adjustments needed regarding the medication regimen.
» **Addressing Barriers:** Sometimes, clients may face barriers to medication adherence, such as cost issues, stigma, or misconceptions about medications. The counselor can work with the client to address these barriers and find solutions.
» **Support and Counseling:** Emotional support and counseling can be offered by the counselor to help the client cope with any challenges related to their MHD and medication management, provide motivation, and assist in developing coping strategies.

Understanding medication side effects is important for client safety. This knowledge allows counselors to track how clients react to medications and quickly report any negative effects. Proactively addressing side effects helps counselors ease client concerns and collaborate with healthcare providers to adjust medications if needed. For instance, some antidepressants and antipsychotics can cause weight gain, which might worry clients with weight issues or body image concerns. Additionally, treatments for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder can lead to serious side effects such as metabolic changes, movement disorders (such as tardive dyskinesia), and heart issues.

The man on the right, presumably a doctor, is wearing a white coat with a stethoscope around his neck and glasses, and he is looking down at a notepad or clipboard he is holding, appearing to be writing or reviewing something. They are in what looks like a clinical or office setting.]
