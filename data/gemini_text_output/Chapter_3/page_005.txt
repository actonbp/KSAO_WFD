A young woman on the left, wearing a striped shirt, looks at him with concern. Another person, possibly a woman with dark hair, stands behind him with a hand on his shoulder.

CHAPTER 3: Co-Occurring Conditions and Special Populations 89

Entry level SUD counselors generally do not diagnose MHDs but may be asked to give a “diagnostic impression.” **A diagnostic impression** refers to an initial determination made by a behavioral health professional regarding what mental health issues or disorders may be present based on observed symptoms and preliminary assessments. It’s a tentative hypothesis about a client’s condition that is used to guide further evaluation and treatment planning. This impression may later be confirmed or revised after more comprehensive testing and analysis. When providing a diagnostic impression, counselors who are not authorized to provide a full diagnosis need to clearly communicate the preliminary nature of their observations. They should emphasize that a definitive diagnosis must be made by a qualified professional.

It is important, however, that all SUD treatment counselors have familiarity with MHD terminology and criteria, as well as to be an active member of the treatment team in providing opinions on how to proceed with clients who demonstrate symptoms of these disorders. The American Psychiatric Association (APA) is recognized as the organization that establishes criteria for diagnosing MHDs, including SUDs.⁶ The major categories include:

1. Mood Disorders (Major Depressive Disorder, Bipolar Disorder, Dysthymia)
2. Anxiety Disorders (Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder)
3. Personality Disorders (Borderline Personality Disorder, Narcissistic Personality Disorder, Antisocial Personality Disorder)
4. Psychotic Disorders (Schizophrenia, Schizoaffective Disorder)
5. Eating Disorders (Anorexia Nervosa, Bulimia Nervosa, Binge Eating Disorder)
6. Trauma-related Disorders (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Acute Stress Disorder, Adjustment Disorders)
