CHAPTER 3: Co-Occurring Conditions and Special Populations 109

Routine gynecological care is fundamental to the prevention or early detection of a variety of serious health problems, including cervical, breast, and other cancers; HIV/AIDS, STIs, and other infectious diseases; infertility, early onset of menopause; and complications during pregnancy and birth. In addition, women who use alcohol or other drugs may not realize they are pregnant. They may mistakenly associate early signs of pregnancy as symptoms related to use or withdrawal from substances and do not begin prenatal care until well into their pregnancies. Some of the most negative effects of substance use on the developing embryo can occur in the first weeks of pregnancy.

Many women with SUDs are also diagnosed with MHDs. In 2022, 11.1 million women reporting an SUD also reported any MHD in the past year.⁸⁴ Women are more likely to experience certain MHDs, such as depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and eating disorders.⁸⁵ The presence of comorbid PTSD is high and primarily due to the experience of trauma exposure related to intimate partner violence, sexual assault, and childhood abuse. Some women report using substances to relieve stress or negative emotions. In addition, women are more vulnerable to developing SUDs or other MHDs following divorce, loss of child custody, or the death of a partner or child. Untreated MHDs among mothers increases the risk for substance use and negatively affect mothers’ ability to care for and respond to their babies.⁸⁶

Women with SUDs also report poorer overall quality of life compared with men.⁸⁷ They are more likely to experience other adverse health outcomes including violence, and particularly IPV.⁸⁸ Problematic substance use in women has been associated with sexual assault, unintended pregnancy, engagement in risky sexual behavior, physical injury, and overdose.⁸⁹ Furthermore, some women who use drugs engage in sex work as a means to obtain drugs or for financial support. Street-based sex workers have complex health and social issues due to high prevalence of injection drug use, poor treatment outcomes, high levels of morbidity and mortality for mental and physical health outcomes, exposure to violence, and homelessness.⁹⁰
