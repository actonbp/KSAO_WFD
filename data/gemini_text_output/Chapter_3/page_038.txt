**4. Family Involvement.** Family involvement is a cornerstone of treatment for adolescents. Family therapy and family psychoeducation can help address underlying issues, improve communication, and strengthen the support system around the adolescent. Engaging family members in the treatment process can provide additional support and reinforce the adolescent's commitment to recovery.

**5. Trauma-Informed Care.** Trauma-informed care involves creating a safe and supportive environment that empowers adolescents and fosters their resilience. Counselors should focus on building a strong therapeutic alliance through consistent, empathetic, and non-judgmental interactions. Counselors should also be knowledgeable about the signs and effects of trauma and how it can influence substance use and behavior. This understanding allows them to tailor their interventions to address the specific needs of traumatized adolescents. Utilizing trauma-informed therapeutic techniques, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) that integrates trauma-specific interventions, can be particularly effective. See Chapter 6 for specific trauma-related interventions.

In the center, a young, light-skinned person with light, braided hair and wearing a light-colored hoodie sits looking down, with their hands clasped in their lap. To their right, a dark-skinned person, likely a counselor, is seated, turned towards the young person, holding a clipboard and pen, and appears to be speaking. Part of another person is visible in the foreground on the left, also seated, and part of a fourth person's hands are visible in the bottom right corner. The setting appears to be an office, with a water cooler in the background to the left, and a window with blinds behind the central figure. The image aims to illustrate a counseling or support group setting.]
