CHAPTER 3: Co-Occurring Conditions and Special Populations 113

promote wellness, including specific evidence-based practices and curricula that are highly effective for women. Comprehensive, gender-responsive models like *Seeking Safety*, *Helping Women Recover* and *TREM* have shown effectiveness in addressing co-occurring SUDs and MHDs in women, resulting in better outcomes as compared to standard treatments.125

4.  **Relationships:** Relationships are often of primary importance to women. Effective treatment and recovery services should have well-trained staff members who attend to the therapeutic alliance. Women also benefit from supportive relationships with other women, such as female peer specialists who can share their experiences as well as linkages to mutual self-help groups among female participants and with other community members can further build women’s recovery capital and engagement.

5.  **Holistic and Comprehensive Services:** Addressing socio-economic barriers such as poverty, unemployment, childcare, and housing instability is essential. Integrated treatment programs that offer job training, housing support, and financial assistance can significantly improve recovery outcomes. Women with SUDs/MHDs may qualify for financial assistance programs such as Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), or local general relief programs.

6.  **Physical Health Needs and Sexual and Reproductive Health Services:** Women often fail to attend to healthcare problems while in active substance use, making primary care services for health needs and chronic conditions essential. Sexuality (including sexual orientation) and patterns in a woman’s sexual history are also important considerations in effective treatment services. Women face significant unmet needs in sexual and reproductive health, including high rates of unintended pregnancies and poor access to contraceptive services. Integrated care models that include sexual and reproductive health services (health education, pregnancy planning, STIs, etc.) help in meeting these needs.

7.  **Family and Pregnancy-Oriented Programs:** Women with children entering treatment benefit from parenting skills training, trauma-informed parenting education, family counseling, child development education, access to children’s services, and supports for other family members’ needs. Programs specifically designed for pregnant and postpartum women have demonstrated improved outcomes in SUD/MHD treatment, prenatal and postpartum care, and breastfeeding rates.126

The woman in the center, wearing glasses and a cardigan over a striped shirt, is actively speaking and gesturing with her hands. Another woman to her right is listening attentively. A woman in the left foreground is seen mostly from the back, showing her dark, curly hair. A fourth woman is partially visible in the background. They are arranged in a circular or semi-circular formation, suggesting a group discussion.]
