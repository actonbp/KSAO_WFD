**Tobacco Use**⁴⁴

Cigarette smoking is the leading preventable cause of premature death in the U.S.⁴⁵ More than 16 million
Americans are living with a disease caused by smoking. Like alcohol, smoking harms nearly every organ in the
body and increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, lung diseases, and many types of cancer. Although smoking
is widespread, it’s more common in certain groups, including men, American Indians/Alaska Natives, **people
with behavioral health conditions**, LGBTQI+ people, and people with lower incomes and education levels.⁴⁶

Smoking rates in people with SUDs, as well as people with MHDs, are two to four times that of the general
population. Smokers with SUDs take up smoking at an early age, consume more cigarettes per day, frequently
use different tobacco products⁴⁷, and have a two to five times lower likelihood of cessation.⁴⁸ In addition,
smoking is much more common among adults with MHDs than those without. In fact, in 2020, 23.1% of U.S.
adults with any MHD reported smoking cigarettes during the past month compared to 14.5% of adults with no
mental health conditions. Overall, approximately 1 in 4 (or 25%) of adults in the U.S. have some form of MHD or
SUD and **these adults consume almost 40% of all cigarettes smoked by adults**.⁴⁹

For every person who dies because of smoking, at least 30 people live with a serious smoking-related illness.
Smoking causes lung diseases such as chronic bronchitis and emphysema, and it has been found to exacerbate
asthma symptoms in adults and children. Cigarette smoking is the most significant risk factor for chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Smoking also substantially increases the risk of heart disease, including
stroke, heart attack, vascular disease, and aneurysm. Cardiovascular disease is responsible for 40% of all
smoking-related deaths. Smoking causes coronary heart disease, the leading cause of death in the U.S. Smoking
is also linked to many other major health conditions—including rheumatoid arthritis, inflammation, and
impaired immune function.⁵⁰

Tobacco use is also a significant contributor to cancer. It can cause not only lung cancer — but also cancers of
the mouth and throat, voice box, esophagus, stomach, kidney, pancreas, liver, bladder, cervix, colon and rectum,
and a type of leukemia. Each year, 660,000 people in the U.S. are diagnosed with and 343,000 people die from
a cancer related to tobacco use.⁵¹ Foremost among the cancers caused by tobacco use is lung cancer. Smoking
increases lung cancer risk five to tenfold, with greater risk among heavy smokers.⁵² Cigarette smoking is not the
only form of tobacco use associated with cancers. Smokeless tobacco has been linked to cancer of the pharynx,
esophagus, stomach, and lung, as well as to colorectal cancer.

Tobacco use, in the context of comorbidity with MHDs and SUDs, creates a significant challenge as it has
such an impact on the overall well-being and health outcomes of affected individuals. The data highlights the
intertwined nature of tobacco use, mental health, and physical diseases, emphasizing the necessity for integrated
care approaches that address smoking cessation as part of the overall treatment strategy.

**HIV**⁵³

Over one million people in the U.S. are living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).⁵⁴ **HIV is a retrovirus
that infects a type of white blood cell called CD4+ T-cells**. It attacks cells that help the body fight infection,
making a person more vulnerable to other infections and diseases. HIV is spread by contact with certain bodily
fluids of a person with HIV, most commonly during unprotected sex (sex without a condom or HIV medicine
to prevent or treat HIV), or through sharing injection drug equipment. If left untreated, HIV can lead to the
disease AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). In the U.S., most people with HIV do not develop AIDS because
HIV medicine taken as prescribed stops the progression of the disease. People who take HIV medicine (called
antiretroviral therapy or ART) as prescribed and achieve an undetectable viral load can **live long and healthy
lives, and will not transmit HIV to their HIV-negative partners through sex**.⁵⁵

HIV can affect anyone regardless of sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, gender, age, or where they live. However,
groups of people in the U.S. are more likely to get HIV than others because of certain factors. Substance use
increases the vulnerability to HIV through several mechanisms. First, it can impair judgment and lead to
