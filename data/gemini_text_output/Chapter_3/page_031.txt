CHAPTER 3: Co-Occurring Conditions and Special Populations 115

» **Prenatal Care:** Offer holistic care that addresses both the health of the mother and the developing fetus.
This includes providing or linking to regular medical check-ups to monitor the pregnancy and manage
any complications, along with mental health services to address co-occurring disorders. Medication-
Assisted Treatment (MAT) should be available when necessary. Pregnant women with OUD should be
informed about buprenorphine and methadone and their safety and effectiveness during pregnancy.
Programs should also include prenatal education, covering nutrition, childbirth preparation, and
parenting skills.

» **Connect Clients with Life-Saving Medications and Harm Reduction Services:** Be familiar with harm
reduction strategies. Naloxone, which can reverse opioid overdoses, should be used if an overdose occurs,
despite potential fetal stress, as recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists
(ACOG). Additionally, providing resources such as HIV and Hepatitis testing, along with vaccinations
(such as Hepatitis B) and appropriate treatments if needed, helps to mitigate further health risks.

» **Postpartum Services:** Ensure women in the postpartum phase receive a range of comprehensive services,
such as regular medical check-ups to monitor the physical health of both mother and baby; post-
discharge follow-up appointments to monitor progress and provide ongoing support; continued mental
health services to address postpartum depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues; continued SUD
treatment and recovery services; parenting classes and other parenting resources; and, ancillary services
and supports through case management.

» **Prepare Clients for Future Healthy Pregnancies:** Offer educational sessions or provide information one-
on-one about the steps to support a healthy pregnancy: how OUD affects a baby; effective treatment
options including medications; the importance of ongoing prenatal care; and managing Neonatal Opioid
Withdrawal Syndrome (NOWS).

By offering these services, SUD treatment programs can provide comprehensive support to postpartum women,
addressing both their recovery and their roles as new mothers.

**Adolescents**

Adolescence is the developmental transition to adulthood that includes rapid changes in the brain and body,
often at different rates and is a time for healthy exploration of identity and learning independence. This life
stage, typically ranging from ages 12 to 18, is characterized by a series of complex tasks that are essential for
healthy physical, psychological/ emotional, social growth. There are significant changes and challenges as
individuals transition from childhood to adulthood which can be stressful because of these rapid changes.¹³⁰, ¹³¹

**Physical Changes**

1.  **Puberty:** Puberty marks the onset of adolescence and is characterized by significant physical
    transformations. In boys, this includes growth spurts, increased muscle mass, deepening of the voice,
    and the development of secondary sexual characteristics such as facial and body hair. In girls, puberty
    involves the development of breasts, the onset of menstruation, and changes in body composition such as
    increased body fat distribution.

2.  **Neurological Development:** The adolescent brain undergoes significant structural changes, including
    synaptic pruning and myelination, which improve cognitive functions such as executive control, decision-
    making, and emotional regulation.

3.  **Hormonal Changes:** Hormonal changes during puberty affect physical development and are responsible
    for the development of secondary sexual characteristics. These changes also influence mood and behavior
    due to the increased production of sex hormones such as testosterone and estrogen.
