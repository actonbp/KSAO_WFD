The involuntary aspect of civil commitment presents tension between an individual’s liberty interests and the
state’s interests in protecting citizens from danger. Those who support involuntary commitment for people with
SUDs/MHDs contend that allowing loved ones, healthcare providers, law enforcement, and others to quickly
secure court orders to confine the person as a last resort is a humane way to potentially save the life of someone
who is experiencing a crisis. Supporters also contend that states have a moral obligation to help those with an
SUD/MHD who cannot help themselves.

For involuntary commitment to work, effective treatment must be readily available while confined, as well as
upon the person’s release. While research indicates that involuntary treatment may be as effective as voluntary
treatment, many who oppose involuntary commitment do so because they believe that the loss of someone’s civil
liberties due to an SUD/MHD outweighs any therapeutic value from such commitment.**20** Additional concerns
surround the variability of civil commitment statutes and their implementation nationwide, and the fact that
outcome data are limited and often not generalizable.**21**
