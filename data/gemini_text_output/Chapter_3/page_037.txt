CHAPTER 3: Co-Occurring Conditions and Special Populations 121

The prevalence of mental health problems and types of disorder are relatively different between genders, with adolescent girls being more prone to experience internalizing disorders such as depressions, anxiety or eating disorders, and boys being more likely to experience externalizing disorders (such as conduct disorder, ADHD).151 The overall level of difficulties with mental health issues during adolescence are significantly higher for girls than boys across a range of mental health problems. Research shows that boys' and girls' emotional difficulties usually begin around 11â€“12 years of age, then diverge significantly from early to mid-adolescence. Findings suggested that early adolescence is a key period for prevention and intervention activity to reduce escalation in mental health problems, particularly for girls.152

IMPLICATIONS FOR TREATMENT153

For the most positive outcomes among adolescents experiencing SUD-related problems, they must have access to age-appropriate intervention, treatment, recovery, practical support such as life skills training and academic support, and meaningful opportunities for involvement and leadership. Adolescents need programs that address their developmental issues, provide comprehensive and integrated services, involve families, and allow adolescents to remain in the most appropriate, but least restrictive setting. As stated in the women's section, there are many subgroups of adolescents that are beyond the scope of this study guide to explore, such as those involved in the juvenile justice system, in foster care, who inject drugs, who are experiencing homelessness, who have developmental disorders or intellectual disabilities, and others.

1. **Developmentally Appropriate Care.** First and foremost, counselors should be informed about and be able to adjust services to meet the cognitive and developmental level, growth, behavior, values/beliefs, and cultural differences among adolescents. Developmentally appropriate care needs to incorporate the distinct developmental stage of the adolescent and any cognitive, social, emotional, and/or developmental delays or disabilities they may have. It is also important to understand the physical and emotional changes that occur during puberty, which vary by gender.

2. **Focus on Engagement.** Substantial numbers of adolescents in SUD treatment do not return after the first session. Efforts are needed to increase the likelihood of retaining an adolescent in treatment.154 Adolescents are reluctant to seek help for a number of reasons: lack of knowledge regarding the signs of substance use and mental health problems; lack of awareness on how to access the system; fear of breaches in confidentiality; a belief that they can handle their own problems; stigma surrounding mental illness; and previous bad experiences.

   Once the adolescent has entered treatment services, counselors can impact engagement by establishing a strong therapeutic alliance and building rapport with adolescents by showing genuine interest in their lives and concerns. This involves active listening, empathy, and validating their experiences (explored in Chapter 4). Counselors should focus on using motivational strategies, tailoring interventions to the adolescent's interests, involving family members, creating a safe and non-judgmental space, and incorporating peer support. Tailoring interventions might involve integrating activities that the adolescent enjoys, such as sports, music, or art, into the therapeutic process. Engaging adolescents in meaningful and enjoyable activities can make treatment more appealing and relevant to their lives. In addition, using technology, such as multimedia tools, social media, and digital platforms, can enhance engagement. Adolescents today are "digital natives," and incorporating technology into counseling can make sessions more relevant and engaging.155

3. **Integrated Care.** To provide integrated services for adolescents, counselors must adopt a holistic approach. Effective integrated care requires collaboration among different service providers, including mental health professionals, medical practitioners, educators, and social workers. Collaborative care increases the opportunities for earlier detection of mental health and substance use problems, and physical health conditions. Effective case management is crucial for service linkages. For instance, a case manager can facilitate an adolescent's return to a community educational setting by coordinating with the treatment team and education officials. This collaboration ensures that educational goals are met while continuing to address the adolescent's clinical monitoring and recovery needs. Earlier in this chapter, models of integrated care were presented.
