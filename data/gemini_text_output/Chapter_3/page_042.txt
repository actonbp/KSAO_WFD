**Meeting the Needs of Older Adults** ¹⁶⁷,¹⁶⁸

Twenty percent of the US population is expected to be 65 years or older by 2030.

With the increasing prevalence of MHDs and SUDs in older adults, it is estimated that 10.1 to 14.4 million older adults will have one or more of these disorders by 2030.

Many risks are associated with the combination of prescription medications and substance use among older adults. Improper use of prescribed medication is common, whether because of cognitive decline or attempting to save money by using their medications sparingly or taking another person’s remaining medications. Mixing these medications with alcohol or illicit drugs can exacerbate health issues or interfere with the effectiveness of prescribed treatments. For example, many prescription medications have interactions with alcohol and illicit drugs. Mixing substances can lead to unpredictable effects, including increased sedation, impaired coordination, and heightened risk of falls or accidents. Certain combinations can also lead to dangerous interactions, such as respiratory depression or liver damage. Lastly, issues such as age-related changes in drug metabolism, potential interactions with over-the-counter medications, dietary supplements, and alcohol as well as cognitive decline make these risky interactions of special concern. Healthcare providers need to carefully assess each individual’s medical history, current medications, and lifestyle factors¹⁶⁶

Older adults with problematic substance use or SUDs often experience a range of co-occurring MHDs. According to the 2022 *National Survey on Drug Use and Health*, approximately one in five adults over 50 years old experienced MHD, SUD or both in the previous year. Depression and anxiety are the most prevalent MHDs in older adults. The Kaiser Family Foundation reported that one in four (24%) of adults ages 65 and older acknowledged anxiety or depression; the rates were highest among those who are female, Hispanic, low income, in relatively poor health, who live alone, or who have experienced recent loss of employment income in their household.¹⁶⁹ Both of these conditions bring significant distress and suffering which can lead to impairments in physical, mental, and social functioning.
