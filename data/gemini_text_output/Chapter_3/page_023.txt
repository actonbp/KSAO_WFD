CHAPTER 3: Co-Occurring Conditions and Special Populations 107

**Women/Pregnant Women**

Women with SUDs have unique biopsychosocial needs that should be addressed if their treatment is to be successful. Extensive research indicates there are notable differences in the prevalence, origin, comorbidities, and treatment responses to SUDs between men and women. These differences are attributed to a range of biological, genetic, environmental, and behavioral factors. Prevalence rates for SUDs vary widely based on substance types, with alcohol use disorders being reported most often for both men and women. Polysubstance use is common in both genders, although it is reported more frequently in men. In the most recent data shows that the gender gap in substance use prevalence and SUDs is narrowing.⁶⁹

The reasons for initiation of substance use and the subsequent development of SUDs involve a network of factors among women. No biopsychosocial characteristic is solely responsible for substance initiation or progression to the development of an SUD. In general, women (relative to their male counterparts), may have an accelerated course of substance use, progressing more rapidly from initiation of substance use to problems with substances, and from problematic substance use to treatment.⁷⁰ This progression is referred to as a “telescoping” course of illness.⁷¹ While women have a greater biological vulnerability to the adverse consequences of substance use, it is important to note that variations in progression and the consequences of substance use may also be linked to socioeconomic status, racial/ethnic differences, and age.⁷²
