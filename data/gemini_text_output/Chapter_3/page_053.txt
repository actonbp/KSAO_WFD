The pie chart on the left is mostly dark, representing "No Past Year SUD" with "16.3M Veterans (81.9%)". A smaller, lighter slice represents "Past Year SUD" with "3.6M Veterans (18.1%)".
To the right is a horizontal bar chart detailing specific SUDs. The categories and their corresponding values are:
- Alcohol Use Disorder: 2.4M (12.1%)
- Drug Use Disorder: 1.7M (8.7%)
- Marijuana Use Disorder: 1.2M (6.1%)
- Pain Reliever Use Disorder: 576K (2.9%)
- Cocaine Use Disorder: 137K (0.7%)
- Stimulant Use Disorder: 119K (0.6%)
- Methamphetamine Use Disorder: 118K (0.6%)
- Heroine Use Disorder: 116K (0.6%)
An x-axis below the bar chart is labeled "0 1M 2M 3M". The caption below the x-axis reads: "Number of Adults with Specific Past Year SUD among Veterans Aged 18 or Older".]

SUDs are a significant problem among U.S. military veterans, with alcohol use disorder and binge drinking (40.2% of alcohol users) as the most significant areas.²³⁶ The 2022 NSDUH also found that veterans continue to engage in various forms of illicit drug use, including marijuana, which remains the most used illicit substance. There was a notable issue with the misuse of prescription drugs (opioids and sedatives) among veterans.

Data also suggests that approximately half of veterans may not connect with available resources, benefits, and services. Without support, more complex behavioral health concerns usually emerge. In 2020, approximately 5.2 million veterans experienced a behavioral health condition; however, more than half of veterans with a MHD did not receive treatment within the past year and more than 90% of those experiencing an SUD did not receive treatment.²³⁷

**SUICIDE**

Suicide among U.S. active-duty service members and veterans remains a critical concern. For active-duty service members, the Department of Defense reports a slight increase in suicide rates in 2022 compared to 2021, although both years saw lower rates than 2020. Efforts to reduce these rates have been ongoing, including the implementation of comprehensive suicide prevention strategies that involve over 100 actions directed by the Secretary of Defense.²³⁸

The Veterans Administrations’ 2023 *National Suicide Prevention Report* reveals the following data related to suicide among veterans:

» In 2021, suicide was the 13th-leading cause of death for veterans overall, and the second-leading cause of death among veterans under age 45-years-old.
» In 2021, there were 6,042 suicide deaths among veteran men and 350 suicide deaths among veteran women.
» The unadjusted rate of suicide in 2021 among U.S. veterans was **33.9 per 100,000** individuals, up from 32.6 per 100,000 in 2020.
