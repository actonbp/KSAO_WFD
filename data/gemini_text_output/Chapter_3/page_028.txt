stress (e.g., poor marital relationships, lack of social support, childcare distress), and certain personality traits like neuroticism and low self-esteem.¹¹⁵ Additionally, perinatal PTSD affects 2% to 9% of women after childbirth, with those having previous sexual trauma at higher risk for obstetric complications and PTSD.¹¹⁶, ¹¹⁷ A California study (CA-PAMR) found most perinatal suicides occur in the late postpartum period (43–365 days after birth), with 36% between 43 days and 6 months, and 47% after six months.¹¹⁸

Despite these alarming statistics, more than 75% women with maternal MHDs do not receive treatment.¹¹⁹ Contributing to this can be a “perinatal depression treatment cascade” where most women with postpartum depression do not get adequate treatment and remain depressed. There is also a significant unmet need for treatment of perinatal SUD. One recent study (2024) found that only 12.8% of pregnant women with past-year SUD received treatment.¹²⁰ Despite the rising need for OUD treatment among pregnant and postpartum women, only 23% of U.S. SUD treatment facilities had specialty care programs for opioid treatment¹²¹ and only 5.5% of these facilities provide childcare.¹²² This highlights a significant gap in the availability of targeted care for this vulnerable population.

**IMPLICATIONS FOR WOMEN’S TREATMENT¹²³**

Specialized programs that offer comprehensive, integrated approaches to treatment combining clinical and social services with care coordination and trauma-informed care have been found to be most effective. Research shows that a comprehensive array of services is required, preferably provided in women-only programs with female-specific content which yields the best outcomes.¹²⁴ Six key elements have been linked to successful outcomes in SUD treatment programs for women: childcare, prenatal care, women-only treatment, mental health treatment, a holistic approach, and services addressing women’s needs. These elements are linked to positive treatment results.

While some of these processes are common in any SUD treatment, it’s crucial to recognize the unique combination of general and specific processes effective for women with children. Identifying these gender-specific pathways can improve treatment effectiveness. Women-specific treatments offer greater benefits for psychosocial well-being, mental health, pregnancy outcomes, and risk reduction for infectious diseases compared to gender-neutral treatments. While it is beyond the scope of this study guide to address all issues pertaining to women, it is important to note that treatment considerations must be made for sub-populations of women who experience considerable adversity – such as women experiencing homelessness or incarceration; women who are members of under-resourced racial/ethnic groups; women in the military; LGBTQI+ people; and women experiencing or who have experienced violence/gender-based violence (GBV) and/or other trauma.

Effective treatment and recovery services for women with SUDs and MHDs require a gender-responsive and integrated approach, addressing the unique challenges these women face. The following evidence highlights key components and approaches that have proven effective.

1.  **Engagement:** Emphasizing engagement strategies for women in SUD treatment, especially those who are pregnant or postpartum, is crucial. These women are at high risk for poor health outcomes, including overdose, making effective engagement essential for their safety and well-being. Active engagement efforts should involve not only the women, but their families, personal support networks, communities, and the clinicians and community-based practitioners who serve them.

2.  **Integrated SUD/MHD and Trauma-Informed Services:** Effective SUD treatment and recovery programs should ensure that women can access screening, assessment, and services for MHDs. Programs with integrated treatment for SUD and MHD treatments with a trauma-informed approach are particularly effective. Safety measures in treatment programs, such as trauma-informed care, non-judgmental support, and comprehensive health services, are also important. Effective treatment and recovery services consist of strength-building approaches and avoid punitive strategies that further reduce self-efficacy and engagement.

3.  **Gender-Responsive and Evidence-based Treatment Models:** Effective treatment and recovery services for women must address a wide range of gender-specific needs. Many interventions and supports can
