CHAPTER 3: Co-Occurring Conditions and Special Populations 127

**IMPLICATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND OTHER SERVICES**

Older adults can benefit just as much as younger adults using prevailing evidence-based treatments. The
practices that work particularly well for older adults include outreach and engagement, intensive case
management, short-term structured counseling along with medications, access to services in regular healthcare
settings, and having behavioral health experts in long-term care facilities. Motivational Interviewing and other
supportive methods that consider older adults’ unique mental, social, and health needs, along with their cultural
values, are important for inclusion in treatment plans.¹⁷⁰

SAMHSA outlines the following principles of care for older adults with problematic substance use, SUDs and/or
co-occurring MHDs. These principles are essential for understanding and improving the care and treatment for
this population:¹⁷¹﹐ ¹⁷²

1. **Understand the Developmental Issues of Aging:** Recognizing the unique physical, psychological, and
social changes that accompany aging is crucial. Healthcare providers must consider how aging impacts
drug metabolism, the risk of interactions between medications, and the greater physical vulnerability to
the effects of substances.
2. **Acknowledge and Address the Diversity Among Older Adults:** This principle emphasizes the need for
personalized care that considers the diverse backgrounds of older adults, including cultural, gender,
racial, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic differences, which can influence the experience and
treatment of SUDs.
3. **Recognize the Difference Between Early- and Late-Onset SUDs Among Older Adults:** It’s important to
distinguish between those who have had a long history of substance issues (early-onset) and those who
develop issues later in life (late-onset), as the causes and appropriate interventions may differ.
4. **Emphasize Client Education, Early Identification, Screening, and Brief Treatment:** Educating older adults
about the risks and signs of SUDs and MHDs is vital. Early identification and screening can lead to timely
and brief interventions, which are often more effective and less disruptive. A comprehensive approach to
screening is essential for depression, anxiety, substance use, chronic pain, risk of and elder abuse.
5. **Engage in Health Risk Reduction Practices:** This includes strategies to minimize the adverse effects of
substance use and promote safer practices, recognizing that absolute abstinence may not be a realistic
goal for all older adults. Three key elements of preventive care for older adults in recovery are nutrition,
exercise, and fall prevention.
6. **Provide Person-Centered Care:** Treatment plans should be tailored to the individual’s specific health
needs, preferences, and goals. This also includes accommodation that needs to be made for the impact
of dementia, language, and hearing barriers. It is important to clearly explain medication and treatment
options, repeat when necessary and provide in writing using friendly, helpful, accessible language.
Tapping into the person’s strengths help to promote self-management and communicate positive views
of aging.
7. **Build Alliances with Older Clients; Use Age-Sensitive Strategies to Engage/Retain Them in Treatment:**
Creating therapeutic alliances through respect, empathy, and collaboration encourages engagement and
retention in treatment programs, which can be particularly challenging with older populations.
8. **Help Older Clients Use Social Networks and Community-Based Services:** Leveraging existing social and
recovery networks and community resources can provide crucial support and reduce isolation, which is
common in older adults with SUDs. Also identify and use aging system resources like peer support and
advanced care planning supports.
9. **Encourage Family and Caregiver Involvement:** Involving family and other caregivers in the treatment
process can improve outcomes by providing additional support and ensuring that care continues outside
of clinical settings. Their involvement can lead to enhanced support, improved communication, increased
treatment adherence, and better management of recurrent substance use and/or mental health symptoms.
