**Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS)**¹⁰⁸

NAS is recognized as a constellation of clinical signs of withdrawal that may occur in neonates after *in utero* exposure to opioids and other substances. It is characterized by signs and symptoms indicating central nervous system hyperirritability, and dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, and respiratory system. In 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration introduced new terminology designating **Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome (NOWS)** as the specific neonatal withdrawal from opioids. The use of this new terminology has become more widespread and NOWS is considered a subset of NAS.

In 2020, expert panels convened to distinguish the differences between NAS and NOWS and provide an accurate and universally applied definition for NOWS. Their findings were published in 2021. The panels identified five of the most common signs that are characteristic of both NAS and NOWS (excessive crying, fragmented sleep, tremors, increased muscle tone, and alterations in feeding) and recommended a universal definition for NOWS:

Clinical criteria for diagnosis of NOWS consist of the presence of clinical elements 1 and 2:
*   (1) **In utero exposure** to opioids with or without other psychotropic substances (recommended to be collected via confidential maternal self-report; toxicology testing also acceptable with maternal informed consent).
*   (2) **Clinical signs** characteristic of substance withdrawal; any 2 of the 5 signs (as listed above).

Regular use of some drugs can cause Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) in which the baby goes through withdrawal at birth. Most research in this area has focused on the effects of opioids (prescription pain relievers or heroin). However, data has shown that use of alcohol, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, and caffeine during pregnancy may also cause the infant to show withdrawal symptoms at birth. The type and severity of an infant’s withdrawal symptoms depend on the drug(s) used, how long and how often the birth mother used, how her body breaks the drug down, and whether the infant was born full term or prematurely.¹⁰⁷

Pregnant and postpartum women are at high risk for fatal opioid overdose, with overdose deaths increasing by 81% from 2017 to 2020. Women with opioid use disorder (OUD) at delivery are 4.6 times more likely to die in the hospital, 3.5 times more likely to have a cardiac arrest, and twice as likely to have premature births, blood transfusions, stillbirths, cesarean sections, and preeclampsia compared to those without OUD. Effective treatment for OUD during pregnancy can improve outcomes for both the mother and baby. However, only 50–60% of pregnant women with OUD receive medication treatment due to significant barriers, such as stigma from healthcare providers, a lack of available treatment providers, legal penalties for disclosing substance use, and the risk of child welfare involvement.¹⁰⁹

Consequences of mental health-related incidents and conditions—which include fatalities from suicide, drug overdoses and poisonings, and certain traumatic experiences, including IPV—now represent the leading cause of pregnancy-related deaths in the U.S.¹¹⁰ Taken together, these incidents accounted for 22.7% of pregnancy-related deaths, according to an analysis of 2017–2019 data from 36 states.¹¹¹ MHDs and/or SUDs were the leading cause of pregnancy-related deaths for White and Hispanic women and the sixth-leading cause of pregnancy-related deaths for Black women (with cardiac and coronary conditions being the leading cause for this group).¹¹² Another study of American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) individuals, in combination with other races, indicated that 31.3% of pregnancy-related deaths were caused by underlying MHDs and SUDs–the leading cause for this group.¹¹³

The postpartum period poses significant challenges, as women often experience intense psychological distress, including anxiety, depression, and perceived stress, compounded by societal expectations. According to the CDC, about 1 in 8 postpartum women suffer from depressive symptoms.¹¹⁴ Risk factors for postpartum depression (PPD) include a history of depression or anxiety during or before pregnancy, postpartum blues, psychosocial
