136 IC&RC Alcohol and Drug Counselor (ADC) Certification Examination Study Guide

**Active Military and Veterans**

The stresses of deployments and the unique culture of the military offer both risks and protective factors related
to substance use among active-duty personnel. Deployment is associated with smoking initiation, unhealthy
drinking, drug use, risky behaviors and MHDs.²²⁸ Service members can face dishonorable discharge and even
criminal prosecution for a positive drug test, which can discourage illicit drug use. Once active-duty personnel
leave the military some protective influences are gone, and substance use and other mental health issues among
veterans become of greater concern.²²⁹

In 2021, 16% of active-duty service members were diagnosed with at least one SUD or MHD. These disorders
include adjustment disorders, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), SUDs,
personality disorders, and psychoses. Female service members had a higher diagnosis rate of 16% compared to
8.3% for male members. The highest prevalence of these disorders was found among service members under
25 years of age, across both sexes. Among all diagnoses, adjustment disorder was the most common, followed
by anxiety and depressive disorders. Notably, the rates of being diagnosed with adjustment disorder, anxiety
disorder (excluding PTSD), or mood disorder were twice as high in females compared to males (e.g., adjustment
disorder was 16% for females and 7.5% for males). SUDs were diagnosed in 3.3% of service members, but it was
the only condition where the prevalence was higher in males (3.4%) than in females (2.6%).²³⁰

**VETERANS**

America’s veterans have served around the world, on every continent, including Antarctica. Although recent
wars in Iraq and Afghanistan often come to mind, most of America’s veterans served before the Global War
on Terror. In fact, of the country’s 16.5 million living veterans, 8.1 million (or nearly 50%) are aged 65 years or
older. Of the total number of living U.S. veterans, 7.8 million veterans, or 43%, served in the Gulf War era and
5.6 million (30%) served during the Vietnam War era from 1950 to 1973.²³¹ This data shows it is important to look
at veterans, not just in terms of their recent service, but in a generational context. Other data shows that men
vastly outnumber women among veterans, notably those who are older than 70 years. During the 1970s, Congress
passed legislation that allowed women to enroll in service academies, which greatly expanded the opportunities
for women to serve in the U.S. armed forces. Since that time, the number of female veterans has increased, and,
in 2022, made up 1 in 10 veterans.²³²

All veterans experience a period of readjustment as they reintegrate into life with family, friends, and
community. Those who have been deployed to combat zones also need to process exposure to combat which may
contribute to problems for veterans, as well as their spouses and family members. Behaviors needed to survive
in a combat zone, such as maintaining a constant state of alertness, may initially translate into troublesome
behaviors in civilian life, such as feeling edgy or jumpy and being easily startled. They may experience a
variety of common stress reactions, including sleeplessness, nightmares, and feelings of sadness, rejection,
abandonment, or hopelessness. Veterans may also struggle to concentrate; engage in aggressive behavior, such
as aggressive driving; and use alcohol, tobacco, and drugs excessively. The intensity and duration of these and
other worrisome behaviors can indicate a more serious problem and the need for professional treatment.²³³

The newest generation of veterans is characterized by an increased number of Reservists and National Guard
members who served in combat zones; a higher proportion of women; and different patterns of injuries, such
as multiple injuries from explosions, than were seen among veterans of previous wars. Many service members
returning from duty in Afghanistan or Iraq experience symptoms of psychological distress, such as PTSD
(23%). It is estimated that between 37%–50% of veterans from these wars have been diagnosed with at least
one MHD. These conditions are strongly associated with SUDs, as are other problems including reintegration
stresses, sleep disturbances, traumatic brain injury (TBI), and violence in relationships. Onset of SUDs can also
emerge secondary to other MHDs associated with these stressors. Between 37%–50% of veterans returning from
Afghanistan and Iraq were diagnosed with a co-occurring SUDs/MHDs, and 63% of those diagnosed with SUDs
also met criteria for PTSD.²³⁴, ²³⁵
