CHAPTER 3: Co-Occurring Conditions and Special Populations 87

**CO-OCCURRING SUBSTANCE USE AND MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS**

The intersection of SUDs and MHDs presents a complex challenge in both diagnosis and treatment. Commonly referred to as **co-occurring disorders** (CODs) or “dual diagnosis,” this term means the simultaneous presence of at least one SUD and one MHD. It is important to note that some clients’ substance use behaviors may not fully meet the strict diagnostic criteria for co-occurring SUDs and vice versa for mental health symptoms and MHDs. For example, an individual may be at the stage of problematic substance use, but not fully at a diagnosable SUD; however, many of the relevant principles that apply to the treatment of CODs will also apply to these individuals. Careful assessment and treatment planning to take each disorder into account will still be important.

SUDs and MHDs have historically been viewed through separate lenses. The interdependence between them is now widely recognized. The 2022 *National Survey on Drug Use and Health* suggests that mental illness (and serious mental illness (SMI) in particular) commonly co-occurs with problematic substance use in the general adult population, and many individuals with CODs go untreated. This survey, based on a sample of 71,369 U.S. civilians ages 12 or older in noninstitutionalized settings offers revealing insights.¹

» Nearly half of young adults aged 18 to 25 (48.8% or 17.0 million people) had either any mental illness (AMI) or any SUD in the past year. This percentage was higher than corresponding percentages among adults aged 26 to 49 (40.6% or 41.7 million people) or adults aged 50 or older (21.5% or 25.6 million people). .²

» The percentage of adults aged 18 or older who had both SMI and an SUD in the past year was highest among young adults aged 18 to 25 (6.0% or 2.1 million people). The percentage of adults aged 26 to 49 with both SMI and an SUD (3.7% or 3.8 million people) also was higher than the percentage among adults aged 50 or older (1.3% or 1.5 million people).

» The percentage of adults aged 18 or older who had either an SUD or AMI in the past year was higher among Multiracial adults (46.4%) than among White (34.0%), Hispanic (31.7%), Black (31.3%), Asian adults (22.5%) or American Indian or Alaska Native adults (35.9%).

» Two (2) in five (5) adults aged 18 or older (40.9%) with co-occurring MHD/SUD in the past year did not receive treatment for either condition. An estimated 37.9% of adults aged 18 or older with co-occurring AMI and an SUD in the past year received only mental health treatment, 4.2% received only substance use treatment, and 17.0% received both types of treatment.

» Three (3) in ten (10) adolescents aged 12 to 17 (28.4%) with a co-occurring major depressive disorder and an SUD in the past year did not receive treatment for either condition. An estimated 49.3% of adolescents aged 12 to 17 with these co-occurring conditions in the past year received only mental health treatment, 1.5% received only substance use treatment, and 20.8% received both substance use treatment and mental health treatment.
