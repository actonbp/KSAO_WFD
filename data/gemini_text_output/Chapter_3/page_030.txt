**IMPLICATIONS FOR WOMEN'S PERINATAL (PREGNANCY AND POSTPARTUM) SERVICES¹²⁷**

In addition to the above-listed services, pregnant women and postpartum
women require other linkages to regular perinatal care ensures that these
women receive medical supervision and appropriate treatment throughout
their pregnancy and in the postpartum period. This helps manage both
SUD/MHD and any pregnancy-related complications with substantial
benefits.
» Prenatal care provides essential monitoring and interventions
  that can reduce the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as
  preterm birth, low birth weight, and stillbirth.
» Linking women to prenatal care allows for early identification and
  management of NOWS. Early planning and treatment can reduce
  the severity of withdrawal symptoms in newborns and improve
  neonatal outcomes.
» Prenatal and postnatal care can integrate a comprehensive
  approach that addresses both the medical and psychosocial needs
  of women with SUD. This includes access to counseling, mental
  health services, and social support systems, which are essential for
  recovery and long-term well-being.
» Perinatal care can offer safe and effective pain management
  strategies during labor and postpartum, tailored to women with
  SUD. This reduces the risk of recurrence of use and ensures that
  pain is managed without compromising recovery efforts.
» Linking women to postnatal care ensures continuity of care
  beyond childbirth. This is crucial for monitoring the health of both
  mother and baby, providing ongoing support for breastfeeding,
  mental health, and recovery, and addressing any emerging health
  concerns.
» Perinatal care can connect women with SUD to vital resources such
  as housing, food assistance, and social services. These resources
  are essential for addressing the broader social determinants of
  health that impact recovery and maternal-child health.

For pregnant women who have an OUD, treatment should be delivered in
the context of specialized programs that include providers who are trained
to care for this population and that offer comprehensive services along
with medications that are available to support treatment. SAMHSA, the
American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM)
and the World Health Organization concur that buprenorphine and methadone, when taken as prescribed, are
safe and effective for treating OUD during pregnancy. Buprenorphine is an effective medication that helps
reduce withdrawal symptoms and cravings without producing the same high, making it a safer option during
pregnancy. In addition to effectively treating OUD, these medications can reduce the risk of a recurrence, limit
illicit substance-related effects on the developing fetus, and help prevent the separation of families. The use of
medications for OUD in combination with prenatal care is associated with reduced risk of obstetric complications
as well as positive outcomes for the baby, including increased birth weight and gestational age at delivery.¹²⁸

Recommendations for direct services for pregnant women include:¹²⁹

» **Provide Universal Prenatal SUD Screening:** Screen all pregnant clients for SUDs at the first prenatal visit
  and continue follow-up screenings. The goal is to identify and treat SUD, improving both medical and
  obstetric care. Providers should reassure clients that the purpose of screening is to support health, not to
  punish, and encourae open discussion about substance use.
