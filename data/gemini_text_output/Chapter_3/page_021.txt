CHAPTER 3: Co-Occurring Conditions and Special Populations 105

Individuals with SUDs are at heightened risk for contracting and transmitting sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Like HIV and viral hepatitis, engaging in risky sexual behavior that often accompanies substance use and injection drug use increases the risk for STIs. In addition, studies have shown that young adults who used an illicit drug were three times more likely to get an STI, and among teens there is an association between substance use and sexual risk behaviors such as ever having sex, having multiple sex partners, not using a condom, and pregnancy before the age of 15 years of age.⁶⁵

Individuals who are involved in the sex trade are particularly vulnerable to HIV and STIs due to high-risk behaviors compounded by substance use. Street-based sex workers often have complex health and social needs due to high prevalence of heroin, cocaine, and injection drug use, poor treatment outcomes, high levels of mental and physical health conditions, and exposure to sexual and physical violence and homelessness.⁶⁶ Sex workers, particularly those with SUDs, may have reduced capacity to negotiate safer sex practices and are often pressured to engage in unprotected sex by clients offering higher payments or drugs.⁶⁷ The criminalization of both sex work and drug use, and the stigmatization of sex workers who use drugs, hinders the delivery of effective and accessible services, including SUD treatment.

Most of the same strategies used to address HIV and viral hepatitis (harm reduction, education, screening, referral to medical care, etc.) can be used proactively to prevent sexually transmitted infection/disease (STI/STD) acquisition and transmission. Specific strategies to address STIs include:⁶⁸

1.  **Screening:** Screening should occur for all sexually active adolescents and for adults at increased risk for STIs. Adults at increased risk for STIs include those who currently have an STI or were diagnosed with one within the past year, do not consistently use condoms, have multiple sex partners, or have sex partners within populations with a high prevalence of STIs. Attention to screening needs to be proactive with populations with a high prevalence of STIs—persons who seek STI testing or attend STI clinics; sexual and gender minorities; persons who are living with HIV, inject drugs, have exchanged sex for money or drugs, or have entered correctional facilities; and some racial/ethnic minority groups.
2.  **Behavioral Sexual Risk-Reduction Counseling:** Counseling strategies are relevant for both adults and adolescents, however, all sexually active adolescents are at increased risk for STIs and should receive behavioral counseling interventions. The most successful approaches are to provide information on common STIs and STI transmission; assess the person’s risk for acquiring STIs; aim to increase motivation or commitment to safer sex practices; and provide training in condom use, communication about safer sex, problem solving, and other pertinent skills.
