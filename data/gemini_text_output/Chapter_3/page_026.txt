**Socio-economic factors.** Challenging life situations and barriers that influence SUDs and MHDs among women often considerably overlap with negative social determinants of health. Women with SUDs may have access to less social support than men which may play a central role in their substance use and recovery. They are particularly likely to: experience economic disadvantage and have less social support; come from families with substance use problems and have a substance-using partner; and have children and be responsible for their care.⁹¹ In general, women with SUDs have less education and employment experience than men with SUDs placing them in a position to rely on men or other family members or turn to sex work for financial support.⁹²,⁹³ In addition, the cost of SUD treatment may be a barrier if services are not provided by the state and there is no insurance coverage.

**Treatment Seeking.** Women are more likely to seek SUD treatment through general healthcare settings or mental health clinics rather than specialized SUD treatment centers. Women often seek treatment due to stressful life events and mental health concerns unrelated to substance use. Additional entry points into treatment include welfare, child welfare, and legal systems, although they are less likely to be court-mandated to treatment. Women prefer SUD treatment centers that offer childcare, as this service significantly reduces barriers to treatment engagement by addressing one of the major challenges faced by parents seeking care. However, many women who are pregnant or have young children do not seek treatment or drop out of treatment early. They may fear that authorities will remove their children from their care if they are unable to have their children with them. In addition, many women don’t seek treatment because the combined burdens of work, home care, childcare, and other family responsibilities, plus attending treatment frequently, can be overwhelming.⁹⁴

**PREGNANT WOMEN**

MHDs and SUDs during pregnancy and the postpartum period affect an estimated 1 in 5 individuals annually in the U.S.⁹⁵ Maternal MHDs (e.g., mood disorders, anxiety disorders, trauma-related disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and postpartum psychosis) and SUDs range in type and severity. Preexisting maternal MHDs and SUDs, including serious diagnoses such as schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorders, may be affected by pregnancy and the postpartum period with risk of increased relapses.⁹⁶ When left untreated, maternal MHDs and SUDs can have long-lasting negative effects on individuals and families—with costs estimated to be more than $14 billion a year in the U.S.⁹⁷

Use of substances during pregnancy is increasingly common. The most commonly used substances during pregnancy are alcohol, marijuana, tobacco, and opioids.⁹⁸ In 2022, 10% of pregnant women engaged in binge drinking or used heavy amounts of alcohol, 7.9% reported use of marijuana in the past month (2.8% used marijuana daily), and 4.8% used cigarettes.⁹⁹ A 2019 PRAMS survey data found that 6.6% of women reported prescription opioid use during pregnancy; among these women, 21.2% reported misuse (accessed from a source other than a healthcare provider).¹⁰⁰ Mothers with opioid-related diagnoses documented at delivery increased by 131% between 2010 and 2017, and the incidence of babies born with withdrawal symptoms, or Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome, increased by 82% over the same period.¹⁰¹

The effects of problematic substance use on both the pregnant woman and the developing fetus may be significant. Research shows that use of tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs or misuse of prescription drugs by pregnant women can have severe health consequences for infants. This is because many substances pass easily through the placenta, so substances that a pregnant woman takes also reach the fetus.¹⁰² Adverse effects of problematic substance use on the fetus are similarly wide ranging. Here are some examples.
» Infants with prenatal opioid exposure may be smaller at birth and have Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome (NOWS), a form of Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome, requiring additional medical care.¹⁰³
» Infants born to mothers with problematic alcohol use can have alcohol-related birth defects, including heart, kidney, bone, or hearing problems; alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorders; or Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders.¹⁰⁴
» Infants born to mothers with problematic marijuana use during pregnancy are at higher risk of being born preterm, having low birth weight, or having long-term brain development issues.¹⁰⁵
» Smoking during pregnancy raises the risk of the baby being born too small, too early, or with birth defects. During the first year of life, there is a higher risk of the baby dying from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).¹⁰⁶
