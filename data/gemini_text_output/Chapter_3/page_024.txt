**FACTORS THAT HINDER ACCESS TO TREATMENT AND RECOVERY**

From initiation to the development of an SUD, women often follow different pathways. These pathways are influenced by many factors such as stigma, relationships, on-going trauma and interpersonal violence, barriers to treatment-seeking and engagement, and lack of social support for recovery among women.73

**Stigma.** The stigma that surrounds women who have problematic substance use/SUDs is not singular. It consists of multiple overlapping stigmas which can include stigma around SUDs, harm reduction approaches, substance type, gender, race, and economic status. Stigma and shame associated with SUDs results in a reduced chance that the individual will seek treatment; influences the kinds of treatment people are willing to accept; and affects treatment retention as well as the individual’s ability to maintain a recovery-oriented lifestyle.74

Women are stigmatized more than men for using alcohol and other drugs because they are perceived as going against their gender roles and characteristics of perceived female identity. The stigma of substance use is also greater for mothers since they are expected to be the caregivers, raise children, and be more family oriented than fathers.75 The internalization of stigma can exacerbate guilt and shame, while discriminatory and gender-blind services may deter help-seeking.76 Pregnant and parenting women using substances face particular societal criticism. Pregnant women often delay seeking services with serious implications for the mother and the fetus.

**Interpersonal Violence and Trauma.** A history of traumatic events including, but not limited to, sexual and physical assaults, childhood sexual and physical abuse, and domestic violence, are significantly associated with initiation of substance use and the development of SUDs among women.77 A high proportion of women with SUDs have histories of trauma, often perpetrated by persons they both knew and trusted. Research shows that histories of trauma put women at increased risk of co-occurring disorders and these disorders present with more severe symptoms and precipitate worse outcomes for women than those with either MHDs or SUDs alone.78

The actual introduction to substances by a significant other is not uncommon and is often their way of increasing control and establishing power over the woman. This type of coercion is considered a form of intimate partner violence (IPV) which includes such tactics as forcing a partner to use substances or to use more than they want; controlling or interfering with a partner’s SUD treatment; or undermining a partner’s recovery.79 A recent systematic review of the literature stressed the significant relationship between IPV and subsequent substance use, SUD diagnoses, and poorer treatment outcomes.80

**Relationships.** From a sociocultural perspective, women (more than men) tend to define themselves in terms of their webs of social relationships and obligations. Relationships with others have special significance for many women. Women are more likely to be introduced to and initiate alcohol and drug use through significant relationships including boyfriends, spouses, partners, and family members. This influence does not stop with initiation; it extends to greater use and higher incidence of SUDs when they have partners who problematically use substances.81

Problematic substance use can affect a women’s connections and relationships, causing them to leave or abandon many of the relational systems on which they formerly depended—family, friends, and roots in the community. Psychological differences between men and women, and the heightened importance that women place on relationships, greatly influence a woman’s gateway into problematic substance use and into a recurrence of use once during recovery. In addition, a woman’s focus within relationships is often to serve as caretaker, a role that can result in a woman’s not attending to her own needs. Positive, therapeutic relationships, however, can act as powerful tools for supporting a woman’s recovery.82

**Co-occurring Physical and Mental Health Conditions.** Women with SUD have greater susceptibility to, as well as earlier onset of serious medical problems. They often have a range of health concerns and chronic health problems that require prevention, primary care, gynecological, and other specialized services. For example, women who use alcohol heavily can develop cirrhosis and heart muscle and nerve damage with fewer years of heavy drinking in comparison to men. Likewise, illicit drug use is associated with greater risk for liver and kidney diseases, bacterial infections, and opportunistic diseases.83
