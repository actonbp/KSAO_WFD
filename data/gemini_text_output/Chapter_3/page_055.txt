CHAPTER 3: Co-Occuring Conditions and Special Populations 139

Veterans who experience homelessness often share several risk factors and characteristics that make them more
susceptible to this situation.241

1.  **SUDs and MHDs**: These are the strongest and most consistent risk factors for homelessness among
    veterans. Problematic substance use, particularly of illicit drugs, and MHDs such as PTSD significantly
    increase the risk of homelessness.

2.  **Low Income and Financial Instability**: Economic factors, including low income and unemployment,
    are critical risk factors. Veterans with unstable financial conditions are at a higher risk of becoming
    homeless.

3.  **Lack of Social Support**: Isolation and lack of family or social support networks also contribute to
    homelessness among veterans. Those who lack a supportive community are more vulnerable to
    homelessness.

4.  **Adverse Childhood Experiences and Trauma**: Traumatic experiences, both in childhood and during
    military service, such as combat exposure or sexual assault, increase the risk of homelessness. These
    experiences often lead to or exacerbate mental health issues that can lead to homelessness.

5.  **Post Incarceration**: Incarceration can lead to residential displacement, limited employment prospects,
    stigma, and disrupted personal relationships, which can ultimately increase risk for homelessness.

6.  **Veteran Specific Factors**: Veterans who served in the era of the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts have
    shown to be at a greater risk, with specific challenges such as PTSD being prevalent risk factors.

**CULTURE OF THE MILITARY AND HELP-SEEKING**

Military culture is deeply rooted in a set of core values that prioritize strength, discipline, and stoicism. These
values are essential for survival and effectiveness in combat but can stigmatize those who express vulnerabilities
such as mental health or substance use issues. The following barriers can deter service members from seeking
the help they need, leading to potential untreated MHDs and SUDs within this population.

1.  **Stigma and Perceptions of Weakness**: In many military contexts, admitting the need for mental health
    or substance use services is often perceived as a sign of weakness. This perception can lead to significant
    stigma, discouraging individuals from stepping forward to seek help.

2.  **Career Concerns**: Many service members fear that acknowledging a mental health or substance use issue
    could adversely affect their career progression or lead to their discharge from the service. This fear can be
    a powerful deterrent against seeking help.

3.  **Lack of Awareness and Access**: In some cases, military personnel may not be aware of the services
    available to them or may have difficulty accessing these services due to logistical challenges, especially in
    remote or combat areas.

4.  **Soldier Identity**: The strong emphasis on soldier ideals within the military can complicate the willingness
    of service members, particularly men, to admit to struggles with mental health or substance use, as these
    admissions can be seen as incongruent with their identities as soldiers.
