**10. Coordinate Care and Develop Service Linkages:** Effective treatment often requires coordinating various types of care (medical, psychiatric, social services) and creating linkages between different service providers to address all aspects of a client's health. It is helpful to understand and explain Medicare benefits, including Part D and preventive benefits (e.g., alcohol screening, depression screening) to patients and their caregivers. Coordinate benefits for dually eligible Medicaid/Medicare beneficiaries, including certain social services that are available with lower cost sharing.

**LGBTQI+**

The percentage of U.S. adults who self-identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or something other than heterosexual has increased to a new high of 7.2%, which is double the percentage from 2012, when Gallup first measured it.173 The past decade has brought remarkable changes in the social, political, and legal status of these individuals. Despite increased visibility and social acceptance of sexual and gender diverse populations, discriminatory policies and practices remain. Many people who are members of these populations—particularly those who are also members of other marginalized populations, such as racial and ethnic minorities—continue to experience stigma, discrimination, and violence where they live, work, play, and pray.174

As the abbreviation LGBTQI+ suggests, this population is not homogenous. It includes individuals with many distinct sexual orientations, gender identities, gender expressions, and variations in sex characteristics. These are complex and interrelated constructs that are conceptually distinct. Each letter stands for a specific group, though the acronym continues to evolve as understanding and recognition of different identities grow. Here’s a breakdown of the common components of the acronym:175

» **L** stands for **Lesbian**: Women who are emotionally, romantically, or sexually attracted to other women.

» **G** stands for **Gay**: Typically refers to men who are attracted to other men, but can also be used as an umbrella term for people who are attracted to the same sex.

» **B** stands for **Bisexual**: Individuals who are attracted to both their own gender and other genders.

» **T** stands for **Transgender**: People whose gender identity differs from the sex they were assigned at birth. This group includes a wide range of gender experiences, including nonbinary, genderqueer, and genderfluid individuals.

» **Q** stands for **Queer/Questioning**: Queer is a term used by some who reject traditional gender identities and seek a broader, more fluid understanding of sexual orientation. Questioning refers to individuals who are exploring their sexual orientation, gender identity, or both.

» **I** stands for **Intersex**: Individuals born with physical sex characteristics that do not fit typical binary notions of male or female bodies.

» **+** represents other identities and expressions that fall under the broader spectrum of sexuality and gender diversity, including pansexual (attracted to people regardless of gender), asexual (lack of sexual attraction to others), and aromantic (lack of romantic attraction to others), among others.

The first three terms—lesbian, gay, and bisexual—refer to **sexual orientation**, which relates to the gender(s) of the people to whom someone feels physically or romantically attracted. Self-identification is how people describe their own sexual orientation. The term **transgender** refers to **gender identity**, which is distinct from sexual orientation. Transgender is a broad term that describes people who identify as a sex or gender different from the sex they were assigned at birth. For example, a transgender woman is a woman who was assigned male at birth, and a transgender man is a man who was assigned female at birth.176 Sexual and gender minorities are also diverse with respect to other identities, including age, race, ethnicity, language, national origin, religion, spirituality, ability, and socioeconomic status.
