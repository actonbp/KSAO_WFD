**Alcohol Use**

Problematic alcohol use in the U.S. is a significant health and social issue, with wide-ranging effects on the body and society. It is a major contributor to injuries, mortality (death), and the burden of disease. Because alcohol tops the list of widely used substances, it needs additional focus. Consider these compelling statistics from the 2022 *National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH)*:

» 61.2 million people ages 12 and older (21.7% in this age group) reported binge drinking in the past month.³¹
» 16.1 million people ages 12 and older (5.7% in this age group) reported heavy alcohol use in the past month.³² That means...
    › For men, consuming five or more drinks on any day or 15 or more per week.
    › For women, consuming four or more drinks on any day or 8 or more per week.
» 29.5 million people ages 12 and older (10.5% in this age group) had alcohol use disorder (AUD) in the past year; of this number, 753,000 were youth ages 12 to 17 (2.9% in this age group) who had AUD in the past year.³³

The number of physiological systems affected by alcohol is staggering both in the scope of medical consequences and in terms of the economics of medical treatment of alcohol-related disorders. Alcohol causes over 200 health issues and around 178,000 deaths annually in the U.S., making it a leading preventable cause of death.³⁴ Most of these deaths are due to long-term heavy drinking or injuries while drunk. Even small amounts of alcohol can increase health risks, like cancer. Recent studies show that alcohol use was found to be linked causally to many disease and injury categories, with more than 40 disease categories being fully attributable to it. Most showed direct relationships with volume of alcohol use—the more alcohol consumed, the higher the risk of disease or death.³⁵ Excessive alcohol use (binge and heavy use) has **immediate effects** that increase the risk of many harmful health conditions. These are most often the result of binge drinking and include the following:

» Injuries, such as motor vehicle crashes, falls, drownings, and burns.
» Violence, including homicide, suicide, sexual assault, and intimate partner violence.
» Alcohol poisoning, a medical emergency that results from high blood alcohol levels.
» Risky sexual behaviors, including unprotected sex or sex with multiple partners. These behaviors can result in unintended pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV.
» Miscarriage and stillbirth or fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) among pregnant women.³⁶
