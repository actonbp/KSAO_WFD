**6. Use Evidence-based Practices.** Using evidence-based practices (EBPs) in the treatment of adolescents
with SUDs/MHDs helps to ensure standards of care are effective, safe, and standardized. EBPs are
developed through rigorous research, providing clinicians with reliable, validated methods that enhance
their confidence and competence. They promote consistency, efficiency, and accountability in treatment,
ensuring resources are utilized effectively and minimizing the risk of adverse effects. EBPs not only
address immediate treatment needs but also support long-term recovery and relapse prevention.

Many EBPs have been found to be effective for adolescents and their families. Chapter 6 in this study
guide presents information in detail in this regard. For now, one example of an EBP for adolescents
is **Community Reinforcement and Family Training (CRAFT).** CRAFT is a parent-focused intervention
designed to help parents facilitate their adolescent's entry into treatment and support subsequent
behavior change. It has been successful in engaging resistant adolescents by improving parent and
family functioning and encouraging adolescents to participate in treatment. ¹⁵⁶

**7. Cultural Competence.** Cultural and gender competence ensures that adolescents and their families
receive effective, respectful care aligned with their cultural beliefs, practices, gender-specific needs, and
preferred language. This approach also respects racial and ethnic identity, sexual orientation, religion,
age, geographic location, and other affiliations. Providers must recognize the relevance of these factors
in the development of substance SUDs/MHDs and the effectiveness of treatments. This is an overarching
principle for all services.

Effective counseling involves adapting evidence-based practices to fit the cultural context of the
adolescent. This could include using culturally relevant metaphors, examples, and culturally specific
interventions. To demonstrate cultural competence that is particularly relevant to adolescents, it is
also important that counselors show tolerance and understanding of younger generations' preferences
in language, fashion, music, and other cultural expressions. Here are several strategies counselors can
employ:

   >   **Embrace Popular Culture:** Stay updated on trends in music, fashion, and language to better build
       rapport and trust with adolescents, making them feel understood and valued.

   >   **Innovative Therapies:** Incorporate a variety of strategies that make treatment more interesting and
       relevant. For example, use music, dance/movement, and art therapies, like using rap and hip-hop, to
       help them express themselves and address issues in a culturally engaging way.

   >   **Incorporate Language Preferences:** Understand and respect adolescent slang and colloquial language
       to communicate more effectively, making them feel comfortable and understood. This doesn’t
       mean the counselor should use slang; rather, the counselor needs to understand the meaning of the
       language used by youth.

   >   **Fashion Sensitivity:** Avoid judging clothing choices and use fashion preferences to understand
       adolescents’ identities and social influences, fostering a positive therapeutic relationship.

   >   **Interactive and Engaging Techniques:** Use multimedia tools, social media, and digital platforms to
       enhance engagement.
