**CRIMINOGENIC RISK**²²³

**Criminogenic risk** is the likelihood that an individual will engage in future illegal behavior in the form of a new crime or failure to comply with probation or parole conditions. Criminogenic factors are risks and needs that research has demonstrated increase the likelihood of re-offense. There are eight such risk factors, termed criminogenic risks:²²⁴

1.  antisocial personality
2.  antisocial behavior
3.  antisocial cognition (thinking and beliefs)
4.  antisocial associates
5.  problematic substance use
6.  problematic marital and family circumstances
7.  problematic circumstances at work or school
8.  problematic circumstances with leisure and recreation

Of these risk factors, the first four are often prioritized in interventions targeting recidivism, because they have been found to have the strongest relationship with criminal offending.²²⁵

Individuals who are involved with the criminal justice system have a diverse range of behavioral health, criminogenic, case management, and social support needs. Some individuals may have higher behavioral health needs and low or no criminogenic risks, while some may have higher needs related to their criminogenic risk and low behavioral health needs. No two individuals are the same, and while many individuals with SUDs and MHDs may be incarcerated for low-level, nonviolent crimes, some individuals may have moderate or high criminogenic risk. All individuals should have access to behavioral health treatment, regardless of their criminogenic risks and needs.

**IMPLICATIONS FOR TREATMENT**

Knowledge about criminal justice procedures, criminal justice professionals, and terminology, and the kinds of experiences people with SUDs and MHDs have with the criminal justice system is essential for serving justice-involved individuals. This knowledge can help counselors tailor treatment services and supports, as well as assist clients in meeting supervision requirements and avoiding further involvement with the criminal justice system. Understanding the roles and functions of criminal justice professionals can help case managers and counselors navigate the criminal justice system with their clients.

Addressing criminogenic risk and need factors is important. This includes programming to address criminal thinking and behaviors, comprehensive case management, prosocial engagement and activities, and vocational and educational supports. Clinical assessment is the first step in treatment and is used to establish the behavioral health needs and services to be addressed in an individual’s treatment plan. Standardized and validated criminogenic risk and needs assessments can be used to direct resources and supports that reduce an individual’s likelihood of recidivism or risk of re-offense.
