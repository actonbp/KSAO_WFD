5. **Tailoring Assessment and Treatment Approaches:**
Standard SUD assessment and treatment models may
need to be adapted to fully address the specific needs
of LGBTQI+ individuals. For example, when gathering
substance use and treatment history, counselors also
need to: gather information about experiences with
discrimination and oppression and LGBTQ+ developmental
milestones (e.g., coming out, first sexual experiences,
transitioning, etc.); and explore possible relationships
between the substance use and these intersecting risk
factors. The use of evidence-based treatment approaches
for this population needs to be examined/used – such as
AFFIRM206 and LGB-Affirmative Cognitive Behavioral
Therapy (CBT).²⁰⁷

6. **Creating an Inclusive Environment:** Ensure that the treatment environment is inclusive and affirms all
gender and sexual identities. This involves using inclusive language, respecting pronouns, understanding
the nuances of gender dysphoria and its impact on substance use, and addressing any LGBTQI+-specific
triggers for substance use.

7. **Training, Education and Supervision:** SUD counselors may require additional training and education to
understand the nuances of LGBTQI+ identities and experiences fully. This training should include an
understanding of the history, culture, and health disparities affecting the LGBTQI+ community, as well
as skills in providing affirming and effective treatment. In addition, counselors should seek guidance
from supervisors who have expertise and experience in LGBTQ+ issues (as possible). This can provide a
safe space to explore and understand the unique needs of LGBTQ+ clients and ensure that the counseling
provided is appropriate. Counselors can also engage in consultation with peers and experts in LGBTQ+
issues to discuss complex cases, share resources, and gain new perspectives.

8. **Collaboration with LGBTQI+ Organizations:** Counselors can benefit from collaborating with organizations
and groups that specialize in LGBTQI+ health and wellness. These partnerships can provide additional
resources, support, and training to enhance the counselor’s ability to serve this population effectively.

**Criminal Justice-Involved²⁰⁸, ²⁰⁹**

People with SUDs and MHDs are over-represented in the justice system. It is estimated that 18% of the general
population has a MHD;²¹⁰ however, an estimated 44% of those in jail and 37% of those in prison have an MHD.²¹¹
Likewise, it is estimated that, of the general U.S. population, 11.4% of 18–25 year olds, and 6.2% of those over 25
years old have an SUD;²¹² however, it is estimated that 63% of people in jail and 58% in prison have an SUD.²¹³
Nearly four (4) in 10 state prisoners (39%) and three (3) in 10 federal prisoners (31%) reported using drugs at the
time of the offense.²¹⁴ Additionally, 60% of youth in juvenile justice facilities met criteria for an SUD.²¹⁵ Most
individuals, in the community and within correctional facilities, do not receive the treatment that they need.

Researchers have found that even brief incarceration leads to adverse consequences, including loss of
employment and future employment opportunities, poorer physical and mental health, loss of housing and
future housing opportunities, and disruptions in family life and social connections.²¹⁶ Incarceration has a
disproportionate health impact on women, sexual and gender minorities, and people of color.²¹⁷ When compared
to individuals without a history of incarceration, incarcerated and formerly incarcerated individuals these groups
have a higher prevalence of chronic medical conditions, premature mortality,²¹⁸ and reduced access to healthcare
services.²¹⁹ Once in the criminal justice system, individuals with SUDs and MHDs stay in jails longer, have an
increased risk for self-harm, and receive more frequent punitive responses to infractions.²²⁰

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a significant concern among individuals involved in the criminal justice
system. Many are frequently exposed to violence and traumatic experiences, particularly women.²²¹ Some
