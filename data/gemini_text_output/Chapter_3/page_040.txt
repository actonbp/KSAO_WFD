**Older Adults**

Nearly 58.6 million Americans are 65 and older, with projections estimating that the population of older adults will grow to 94.7 million in 2060.¹⁵⁷ On average, a 65-year-old (man or woman) can expect to live another 17 years.¹⁵⁸ Older adults remain physically active for longer than ever before. For most older adults, good health ensures independence, security, and productivity as they age. Unfortunately, millions struggle every day with challenges such as chronic diseases, falls, physical inactivity, oral health concerns, and behavioral health issues—all of which can severely impact quality of life.¹⁵⁹

**AGE VARIATIONS**

It is important to note that the term “older adults” has variation. Older adults (age 65 and older) are further divided into subgroups – “young old” (65-74 years), “middle old” (75-84 years) and “oldest old” (85+ years).

These groupings help to understand the variability in individual experiences. When considering age, it is important to consider an individual’s functional age as well as their chronological age.

The number of older adults with SUDs is increasing. The U.S. population of older adults increasingly consists of baby boomers. Baby boomers came of age at a time when substance use tended to be more culturally acceptable, making them more open to and less judgmental about substance use than prior generations. (Not all subgroups of baby boomers experienced this openness and freedom from judgment about substance use, such as racially and ethnically diverse populations.) Because of baby boomers’ exposure to drugs and alcohol at a younger age, their generation has higher rates of past or current SUDs compared with previous generations.¹⁶⁰

Both SUDs and MHDs among older adults present a complex challenge. Older adults often have unique physiological, psychological, and social conditions and face an increasing prevalence of SUDs. Aging can lead to social, psychological, and physical changes that may increase vulnerability to problematic substance use. Despite their growing numbers, SUDs in older adults remain underestimated, underdiagnosed, and often untreated, which can prevent effective management and worsen health disparities.

Substance use in older adults is dangerous and potentially deadly. The vulnerability of older adults, 80% of whom have at least one chronic illness, and 77% of whom have two, results in complex conditions when substance use is added to the mix.¹⁶¹ There are many areas of vulnerability which makes identifying and treating SUDs in older adults especially critical.¹⁶²

**Physiological Vulnerabilities**

1.  **Increased Sensitivity to Substances**: Due to physiological changes associated with aging, older adults have reduced organ function, including hepatic and renal impairments, which can alter the metabolism and elimination of drugs. This increased sensitivity often results in more pronounced and prolonged effects of substances, raising the risk for overdose and adverse drug interactions.

2.  **Polypharmacy**: Many older adults are prescribed multiple medications to manage various chronic conditions. The combination of prescribed medications with alcohol or other substances of abuse can lead to dangerous interactions and increase the risk of unintentional misuse or overdose.

3.  **Mobility Issues**: Many older adults have difficulty walking or not having access to mobility assistance devices (like a walker or wheelchair). They may also be unable to travel to appointments (e.g., not having a car, not having access to public transportation).

**Psychological and Cognitive Vulnerabilities**

1.  **Neurocognitive Disorders**: Substance use can worsen existing cognitive impairments such as dementia or precipitate new cognitive deficits. This complicates the diagnosis and management of SUDs as the symptoms of substance use can often mimic or mask the signs of cognitive decline.
