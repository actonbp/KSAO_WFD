92 IC&RC Alcohol and Drug Counselor (ADC) Certification Examination Study Guide

One evidence-based practice used extensively is **Assertive Community Treatment (ACT)**. ACT was originally developed as a comprehensive approach to providing mental health services to individuals with severe and persistent MHDs.¹² The program model is designed to deliver intensive, personalized, and integrated services to clients in their natural environments, such as their homes or communities, rather than in traditional institutional settings. This includes assertive engagement with active outreach. ACT teams typically consist of a multidisciplinary group of professionals, including psychiatrists, nurses, social workers, counselors, and case managers, who work collaboratively to provide holistic care and support. ACT has evolved and been modified to address the needs of individuals with both MHDs and SUDs.¹³ It has the following features:

» **24/7 Availability:** ACT teams are available around the clock to provide crisis intervention and support, aiming to prevent hospitalizations and promote stability.
» **Personalized Care Plans:** Each client receives an individualized care plan that addresses their unique needs, goals, and preferences, with a focus on recovery and improving quality of life.
» **Integrated Treatment:** ACT emphasizes the integration of mental health services with other supports such as housing assistance, vocational training, SUD treatment, and peer support.
» **Practical Assistance in Life Management:** This feature incorporates case management activities that facilitate linkages with support services in the community. The role of a counselor in the ACT approach includes standard counseling, but in many instances substantial time also is spent on life management and behavioral management matters.

**MEDICATION FOR MHDs**¹⁴

MHDs are diseases of the brain or central nervous system. They affect a person's thinking, emotions, and mood. Medications play a key role in treating these disorders and are commonly used alongside other treatments such as counseling and brain stimulation therapies. Finding the right medication often involves trials to identify one that works effectively with minimal side effects.

Medications might be known by the disorders they most commonly treat but can be used for other disorders. For instance, a drug known as an “antidepressant” might also be useful for anxiety or eating disorders. Similarly, antipsychotics, while primarily linked to schizophrenia, are also used for bipolar disorder and severe depression. Given that medications can serve multiple purposes, it is essential to clarify for which condition a medication is prescribed.

The medication regimen may vary throughout the course of treatment, influenced by symptom severity, the client's age, and the effectiveness of initial treatments. Over time, a medication might become less effective, necessitating changes to the regimen or the addition of new drugs. Treatment approaches can also include periods without medication. For children and adolescents, it is crucial to carefully choose and monitor medications, as their reactions and side effects can differ from adults'. Certain medications, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), carry FDA warnings about potential risks, including an increased likelihood of suicidal thoughts in younger individuals. In some cases, medications approved for adults are prescribed off-label to treat symptoms in children, requiring vigilant monitoring.

A comprehensive care team is essential for managing MHD medication, including primary care providers, psychiatrists, and behavioral health professionals such as psychologists, social workers, or counselors. This team coordinates to monitor the effects and adjust treatments as needed, ensuring that medications are managed safely and effectively. An SUD counselor can play an important role in helping a client manage medications for a MHD in several ways.
» **Education:** The counselor can educate the client about the purpose, benefits, and potential side effects of their medications. This knowledge helps the client make informed decisions about their treatment plan.\
» **Medication Adherence and Monitoring:** The counselor can provide strategies to help the client remember to take their medications regularly and may monitor medication adherence and progress. This can involve regular check-ins, asking about any side effects or changes in symptoms, and assessing whether the medication is effectively managing the MHD.
