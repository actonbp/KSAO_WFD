1.  Offer universal HIV screenings for people experiencing SUD.

2.  Make medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) available to help reduce the incidence of injection drug use.

3.  Implement ongoing HIV screenings and testing, prescribe PrEP and PEP, provide education on harm reduction strategies (e.g., condom use, not sharing needles), and implement counseling programs to support continued SUD recovery and prevent HIV for clients experiencing SUD who are not living with HIV.

4.  Link clients who are living with HIV to primary care.

5.  Develop treatment plans that integrate comprehensive care to address both conditions simultaneously and holistically.

6.  Ensure case management services are available for coordinated care, access to resources, and support. This includes having a network of referral sources for services not provided within the organization, including medical care, mental health, and social/recovery supports.

In summary, HIV testing, counseling, and linkage to care, particularly among people who inject drugs, is crucially important not only to the health of the individual but also as a means of decreasing HIV transmission.

**Viral Hepatitis**⁶¹, ⁶²

Tens of thousands of new cases of viral hepatitis occur every year in the U.S. Viral hepatitis is a serious public health threat that kills thousands of Americans annually and is a leading cause of liver cancer. Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver. It can be caused by a variety of toxins (such as drugs or alcohol), autoimmune conditions, or pathogens (including viruses, bacteria, or parasites).

Hepatitis is caused by different viruses, known as **hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E**. Each strain has distinct characteristics, modes of transmission, and geographic prevalence. Left untreated, hepatitis can lead to cirrhosis of the liver. It can also lead to a type of liver cancer called hepatocellular carcinoma.

» **Hepatitis A Virus (HAV)** is a vaccine-preventable disease caused by infection of the liver with the hepatitis A virus (HAV). HAV is usually transmitted person to person through the fecal–oral route or through consumption of contaminated food or water. Hepatitis A is a self-limited disease that does not result in chronic infection. Treatment for HAV infection might include rest, adequate nutrition, and fluids. Vaccination can prevent HAV infection.

» **Hepatitis B Virus (HBV):** Hepatitis B is a vaccine-preventable disease caused by infection of the liver with the hepatitis B virus (HBV). HBV is transmitted when blood, semen, or another body fluid from a person infected with the virus enters the body of someone who is uninfected. This can happen through sexual contact; sharing needles, syringes, or other drug-injection equipment; or from the gestational parent to baby during pregnancy or at birth. For some people, hepatitis B is an acute, or short-term, illness; for others, it can become a long-term, chronic infection. Chronic hepatitis B can lead to serious health problems, including cirrhosis, liver cancer, and death. A vaccination available and recommended.

» **Hepatitis C Virus (HCV):** Hepatitis C is a disease caused by infection of the liver with the hepatitis C virus (HCV). HCV is a bloodborne virus. Transmission can happen through sharing needles, syringes, or other drug-injection equipment; from the gestational parent to baby during pregnancy or at birth; or (rarely) through sexual contact. Since 2012, there have been more deaths due to hepatitis C than all 60 of the other reportable infectious diseases combined.

Today, in the U.S., the majority of people become infected with HCV by sharing needles or other equipment used to inject drugs. For certain people, hepatitis C is a short-term illness, but for about
