**IMPLICATIONS FOR TREATMENT**

As reviewed in Chapter 2, the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) have extensive healthcare systems that use a variety of strategies to address SUDs and MHDs among active-duty service members, reservists, and veterans. They have comprehensive clinical guidelines to standardize modern practices for these disorders across their systems. Although the military health system is the primary health care provider for these individuals, the civilian behavioral health treatment system must be prepared to effectively provide needed services for those who access help at the community level.

Community-based, non-military counseling professionals, including SUD counselors, can effectively serve veterans with SUDs and MHDs by adopting a combination of approaches that includes specialized training, cultural competence, integrated treatment models, and collaboration with veteran-specific resources. Here are some examples:

1.  **Specialized Training**: Professionals should seek training that focuses specifically on the unique aspects of military culture and the common mental health challenges faced by veterans, particularly for PTSD, depression, and anxiety.

2.  **Cultural Competence**: Understanding military culture is critical. Counselors should familiarize themselves with the military’s structure, values, and common experiences, such as the significance of camaraderie and the impact of combat exposure. This understanding can help in building trust and rapport with veteran clients.

3.  **Integrated Treatment Approaches**: Since SUDs and MHDs often occur together, it’s important for counselors to use integrated treatment plans and strategies that address both issues simultaneously. This might include combining evidence-based treatments with medication management, addressing underlying trauma, and developing coping strategies.

4.  **Trauma-Informed Care**: Many veterans may have experienced traumatic events, both in and out of military settings. Adopting a trauma-informed care approach ensures that therapists provide treatment that acknowledges the role of trauma to help in creating a safe environment for veterans to discuss their experiences.

5.  **Collaboration with Veteran Services**: Establishing connections with local VA centers and veteran organizations can provide additional support and resources. These partnerships can facilitate referrals, provide access to specialized programs, and support comprehensive care plans tailored to veterans’ specific needs.

6.  **Peer Support Programs**: Encouraging linkage with a Peer Specialist and participation in or facilitating peer support groups can be beneficial. Mutual-help groups offer a space where veterans can share experiences and recovery strategies with others who have faced similar challenges.
