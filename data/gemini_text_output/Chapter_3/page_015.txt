CHAPTER 3: Co-Occurring Conditions and Special Populations
99

Heavy alcohol consumption has been linked to many long-term effects and the increased risk and incidence of
serious diseases. Here are several examples.

» **Liver:** Alcohol primarily affects the liver, causing diseases like fatty liver, inflammation, and cirrhosis,
which can lead to liver failure and the need for transplants. The most serious form of liver damage
is **cirrhosis**. This irreversible liver disease is characterized by scarring and cell death. Chronic alcohol
consumption induces liver fibrosis (scarring) by stimulating the fat-storing cells of the liver to
differentiate into collagen-producing stellate cells. It is believed this leads to irreversible cirrhosis.³⁷

» **Alcohol-Associated Hepatitis (AH)** is a clinical syndrome that develops suddenly in approximately 20%
of people who drink heavily. AH is characterized by a rapid onset of jaundice, liver synthetic dysfunction,
and hepatic decompensation. An episode of AH is frequently the first clinical presentation of advanced
liver disease. About 10% to 20% of people with AH are likely to progress to cirrhosis annually, and 10% of
the individuals with AH have regression of liver injury with abstinence.³⁸

» **Endocrine System:** Heavy alcohol use can disrupt the endocrine system, which includes glands like the
thyroid and adrenal glands, as well as other hormone-producing parts of the body such as the pancreas
and fat tissue. This can lead to hormonal imbalances and interfere with how hormones communicate
with the nervous and immune systems. These disruptions can contribute to the development of diabetes.
Additionally, heavy drinking can increase the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes through several factors,
such as gaining weight, higher levels of blood fats, increased blood pressure, and reduced sensitivity to
insulin—all of which are risk factors for diabetes.³⁹

» **Central Nervous System:** The central nervous system is a major target for adverse effects of alcohol and
when used extensively promotes the development of a significant number of neurological diseases such as
stroke, brain tumor, multiple sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
(ALS). Heavy alcohol use over time damages the brain through a combination of direct neurotoxic effects,
nutritional deficiencies, neuroinflammation, liver disease, and metabolic abnormalities, all made worse
by aging. Brain damage due to alcohol can manifest in problems with attention, memory, and reasoning.
Abstinence may partially reverse these changes.⁴⁰

» **Cardiovascular Diseases:** Excessive alcohol consumption can seriously harm heart health. While
moderate drinking might slightly reduce the risk of some heart diseases, heavy and frequent drinking can
lead to several heart problems. Alcohol can damage the heart muscle, raise blood pressure, and increase
the risk of heart failure and stroke. It can also harm different body tissues, cause various physical
changes, and disrupt hormone levels and chemical processes in the body. Long-term heavy drinking
is known to cause high blood pressure, heart muscle disease, irregular heartbeats, heart failure, heart
attacks, heart muscle disorders, reduced blood flow to the heart, and strokes.⁴¹

» **Cancer:** There is a strong scientific consensus that alcohol drinking can cause several types of cancer.
Alcohol use increases the risk of cancers of the liver, colon, rectum, mouth, pharynx, larynx, esophagus,
and female breast. It has been found to have a "dose-response relationship”, indicating that as alcohol
consumption levels increased, the risk of cancer also increases for most cancer types.⁴² Alcohol can
increase cancer risk through it byproducts and can also damage the liver, which can lead to inflammation
and cirrhosis, or scarring of the liver.⁴³

To summarize, alcohol's impact is vast, affecting multiple body systems and contributing to significant health
risks. Thus, it is important to be aware that developing or worsening medical conditions in many clients may
reflect an unrecognized alcohol problem. The health risks reinforce the need for regular alcohol screening for all
clients, and, when warranted, SUD counselors can use brief interventions to raise their clients' awareness about
their specific alcohol-related health consequences, which may help motivate them to cut back or quit as needed.
