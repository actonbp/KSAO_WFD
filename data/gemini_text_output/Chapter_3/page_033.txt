CHAPTER 3: Co-Occurring Conditions and Special Populations 117

**4. Technological Proficiency:** While this has not historically been a developmental task, it plays an
important part in social relationships and mental health. With the pervasive role of technology,
adolescents must develop appropriate social media habits and self-regulatory practices in using digital
tools and platforms.132, 133

**Relational Tasks**

**1. Family Relationships:** Maintaining and renegotiating family relationships is critical. Adolescents strive to
balance the need for independence with the need for family support and connection.

**2. Romantic Relationships:** Exploring romantic relationships is another significant task. These relationships
help adolescents understand intimacy, commitment, and the complexities of emotional connections.

**3. Conflict Resolution:** Learning to navigate and resolve conflicts in a healthy manner is essential. This skill
is important for maintaining positive relationships and managing social dynamics.

**ADOLESCENTS AND SUBSTANCE USE**

During the stages of adolescent development, individuals are particularly vulnerable to experimenting with
substances, which can lead to SUDs. Substance use during adolescence is a major concern due to its potential to
disrupt healthy development and lead to long-term adverse consequences. Early alcohol and other drug abuse
correlates with problematic substance use later in life, and the most significant increases in destructive behavior
appear to take place among older teens and young adults.

Consider these overarching statistics (2022) about problematic substance use in adolescents:134
» 2.08 million or 8.33% of 12- to 17-year-olds nationwide reported using drugs in the last month.
» 8.7% of 8th graders have used illicit drugs in the last month.
» 21.3% of 8th graders have tried illicit drugs at least once.
» By the time they’re in 12th grade, 46.6% of teens have tried illicit drugs.
» 11.89 million 18- to 25-year-olds used drugs in the last month.
» 11.2% of overdose deaths are among teens and young adults aged 15 to 24 years.

The 2022 NSDUH presents specific statistics on problematic substance use for individuals aged 12 -17, shown by
the following percentages and population estimates.135
