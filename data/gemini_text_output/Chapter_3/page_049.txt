CHAPTER 3: Co-Occurring Conditions and Special Populations 133

researchers suggest that the trauma people experience behind bars can lead to Post-Incarceration Syndrome (PICS)
a syndrome that shares characteristics with PTSD, in addition to a specific cluster of mental health symptoms,
including institutionalized personality traits (like distrusting others, difficulty maintaining relationships, and
problems making decisions), social-sensory disorientation (issues with spatial reasoning and difficulty with
social interactions), and social and temporal alienation (the feeling of not belonging in social settings).222 Due
to funding and staffing limitations, many people with MHDs do not receive the services they need and their
conditions often worsen inside jail and prison settings.

Most incarcerated individuals return to their communities, families, and social networks and subsequently
require community-based behavioral and physical healthcare services. They often encounter significant barriers
to behavioral health treatment, stable and safe housing, meaningful employment, and other recovery support
services. Community-based behavioral health providers play a key role in ensuring that every individual they
serve has the treatment, support, skills, and opportunity for recovery and lives productively with dignity and
respect.
