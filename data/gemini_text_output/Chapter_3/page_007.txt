CHAPTER 3: Co-Occurring Conditions and Special Populations
91

Integrated interventions are combined in a single session/interaction or
in a series of interactions/multiple sessions. Integrated interventions can
include a wide range of techniques. Some examples include:
    »   Integrated screening and assessment processes.
    »   Dual recovery mutual-support group meetings.
    »   Dual recovery therapeutic groups.
    »   Motivational enhancement interventions (individual or group) that
        address both MHDs and SUDs.
    »   Group interventions for people with the triple diagnosis of mental
        MHD, SUD, and another problem, such as a chronic medical
        condition (e.g., HIV), trauma, homelessness, or criminality.
    »   Combined psychopharmacological interventions, in which a person
        receives medication designed to reduce cravings for substances as
        well as medication for a MHD.

Integrated interventions for people with CODs can be implemented within
a single program or across multiple settings. These disorders vary widely
in severity and impact, requiring different levels of care ranging from
intensive inpatient services to occasional outpatient treatments. Not
everyone will need the same services or move through treatment in a
straightforward path. Clients may move between more and less intensive
care depending on their symptoms, capabilities, stability, and readiness
for change. For counselors specializing in SUDs, it’s crucial to work as part
of or in close collaboration with integrated treatment teams. These teams
often include various specialists like psychiatrists, psychologists, and
social workers who work together to create comprehensive, individualized
treatment plans.

**EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENTS**

Treating CODs presents unique challenges, as clients can have lower rates
of retention in services, more frequent recurrence of symptoms, and more
complex clinical management. SUD counselors need to be prepared for a
potentially prolonged treatment process and should be adept at managing
these challenges through continuous monitoring and adjustment of
treatment plans. The use of evidence-based treatment practices that have
shown efficacy in treating CODs can help facilitate the treatment process.

Here are several that have high levels of effectiveness for people with
CODs. These are reviewed in detail in Chapter 6. Evidence-based Practices.
    »   **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** CBT is effective in treating a range of MHDs and SUDs by helping
        clients understand the relationship between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors and by developing coping
        strategies to manage triggers and cravings.
    »   **Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT):** Originally developed for borderline personality disorder, DBT
        has been adapted for substance use treatment. It helps clients develop skills in mindfulness, distress
        tolerance, emotion regulation, and interpersonal effectiveness.
    »   **Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT):** MAT can be used to manage withdrawal symptoms, reduce
        cravings, and treat underlying MHDs. Medications like methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone for
        opioid use disorders, along with antidepressants or mood stabilizers, are commonly used.
    »   **Motivational Interviewing (MI):** This technique enhances a client’s motivation to change by resolving
        ambivalence, an essential component in treating clients with CODs who may have conflicting feelings
        about substance use and recovery.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**

Co-occurring disorders are
complex. They present significant
challenges for people living with
these disorders as well as for
the counselors, administrators,
supervisors, and programs who
treat them. To help address the
full range of symptoms that clients
experience and optimize outcomes,
service providers must understand
the components high-quality
care for CODs and use treatment
frameworks, philosophies, and
approaches empirically shown to net
the best outcomes.
