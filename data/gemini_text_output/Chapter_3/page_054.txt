The report also addresses the risk factors that they believe to have contributed to the suicide rate among
veterans:

“Veteran distress increased from fall 2019 to fall and winter 2020, with evidence of the highest
increases in distress among veterans aged 18- to- 44-years-old and among women veterans.
These increases in reported distress were associated with increasing socioeconomic concerns,
greater problematic alcohol use and decreased community integration. A systematic review of 23
studies found increases in the prevalence rates of alcohol use, anxiety, depression, posttraumatic
stress disorder, stress, loneliness, and suicidal ideation. The results of this systematic review found
key risk factors to include pandemic-related stress, family relationship strain, lack of social support,
financial concerns and preexisting mental health disorders.”

**HOMELESSNESS**

Veterans have been overrepresented in the homeless population since at least the late 1980s. The rate of
homelessness among this population has shifted significantly in the past decade. In 2023, 35,574 veterans
were experiencing homelessness—22 of every 10,000 veterans in the U.S. The number of veterans experiencing
homelessness increased by 7% (2,445 more veterans) between 2022 and 2023; however, despite increases in
experiences of veteran homelessness between those years, **the number of veterans experiencing homelessness**
**is 52% lower than it was in 2009,** the baseline year for reporting veterans experiencing homelessness in the
annual report to Congress.²³⁹

The presence of veterans within the general U.S. homeless population is regarded as a point of public shame
by many; however, public concern for their health and well-being has been strong. The reduction in veteran
homelessness is largely the result of actions at the federal level between 2010 and 2019, when a collaborative
effort to end veteran homelessness was very active. Two key strategies contributed to this success: (1) the
adoption of the **Housing First** approach and (2) substantial investments in veteran-specific programs. The
Housing First strategy significantly reduced the waiting times for housing placement from 223 days to 35,
improved the stability of housing for veterans, and decreased visits to the emergency room.²⁴⁰ Additionally,
the Supportive Services for Veterans Families (SSVF) program, started in 2011, provided rapid re-housing
and prevention services, successfully stabilizing over 70% of its participants in permanent housing. These
programs, supported consistently by Congressional funding, have been crucial in significantly reducing veteran
homelessness.
