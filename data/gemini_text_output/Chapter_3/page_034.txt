Although this prevalence of use represents a significant number of adolescents, the Monitoring the Future (MTF) Survey shows this represents a decline in alcohol and drug use. The MTF survey is an ongoing national survey of adolescents (secondary school students) in the U.S. It analyzes the data by grade in school rather than by age and presents historical trends in use by students in those grades. The 2021 MTF survey reported significant decreases in substance use among youth in the year of the pandemic onset. For example, for each grade the declines in past 12-month use of marijuana from 2020 to 2021 were the largest ever recorded by the survey (since 1975 for 12th grade students and since 1991 for 10th and 8th grade students). Record decreases also took place for alcohol use and nicotine vaping, which together with cannabis have been the most common forms of substance use among adolescents in recent years.136

The 2023 MTF Survey reveals that adolescent drug use for common substances has remained low since the pandemic began. Key findings include:
» In 2023, lifetime prevalence of illicit drug use (excluding marijuana) was 8% for 8th graders, 9% for 10th graders, and 12% for 12th graders.
» Marijuana use has shown little change since a significant drop in 2021. Among 12th graders, lifetime daily use was 21% in 1982, fell to 8% by 1992, rose to 19% by 1997, and gradually declined to 12% by 2018, remaining stable in 2023.
» Alcohol use has seen a long-term decline since 2000. From 2001 to 2023, past 12-month prevalence decreased from 73% to 46% in 12th grade, from 65% to 31% in 10th grade, and from 43% to 15% in 8th grade.
» Abstaining from marijuana, alcohol, and nicotine increased among 12th graders, with 62.6% reporting no use in the past month. This percentage for 8th and 10th graders was at 87.0% and 76.9% respectively.

MTF report states that it is possible that these decreases will hold for future years going forward, or, instead, alcohol and drug prevalence levels may bounce back to where they were before the pandemic (as recorded by MTF with the 2020 results) as youth have returned to schools and social environments with peers.

The opioid epidemic, however, has profoundly impacted adolescents, leading to increased rates of SUDs and related adverse outcomes. Adolescents are increasingly exposed to opioids, particularly synthetic opioids like fentanyl. Fentanyl, often mixed with other drugs, has significantly contributed to the rise in overdose deaths among youth. From 2019 to 2020, 90% of youth overdose deaths involved opioids. The annualized rate of drug overdose deaths among adolescents aged 14 to 18 years increased to a current high of 5.49 deaths per 100,000 youth – primarily driven by the increased prevalence of illicitly manufactured fentanyl. Within the past decade, fentanyl-related fatalities increased among youth, with fentanyl identified in 77.14% of adolescent overdose deaths by 2021, compared with 5.76% for prescription opioids and 2.27% for heroin.137, 38

In addition to mortality, substance use during adolescence disrupts healthy development in numerous ways:

» The adolescent brain is particularly vulnerable to the effects of substances due to its ongoing development and maturation. Substance use during adolescence can lead to significant changes in neurotransmitter systems and receptor functions and alteration in brain structure. This disruption affects the brain's reward system, leading to increased addiction risk and behavioral dysfunctions such as impaired decision-making and increased impulsivity. Adolescents may experience long-lasting cognitive deficits, including impaired memory, attention, and executive functions that last into adulthood.139
» Behavioral and psychological changes include a higher risk of developing SUDs later in life and a higher prevalence of MHDs, including depression, anxiety, and antisocial personality disorder. Substance use can also negatively impact emotional regulation and social interactions leading to difficulty in forming healthy relationships and may experience increased social isolation and difficulty in social integration.140
