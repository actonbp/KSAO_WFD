**Signs and Symptoms**

The main signs of DMDD include:
» Severe temper outbursts (verbal or behavioral) that are grossly out of proportion in intensity or duration
to the situation.
» Outbursts are inconsistent with the developmental level of the child.
» Mood between outbursts is persistently irritable or angry most of the day, nearly every day, and
observable by others in the child’s environments (like at home, at school, or with peers).
» Symptoms must be present for 12 or more months to be officially diagnosed as DMDD.

**Sub-types of the Disorder**

DMDD is not currently classified into sub-types but is distinguished by the pattern and frequency of outbursts
and the baseline mood state.

**Medications Used to Treat the Disorder**

The treatment for DMDD often involves a combination of medication and psychotherapy to help manage
symptoms and improve behavior. Commonly prescribed medications include:
» **Antidepressants**: SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors) may be used to help stabilize mood
swings and reduce irritability and depressive symptoms.
» **Psychostimulants**: These are often used if there is a co-existing attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD).
» **Antipsychotic Medications**: In some cases, these may be prescribed to help reduce the severity of temper
outbursts.

Psychotherapy, particularly Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), is also a crucial part of treatment and usually
focuses on helping the child develop more effective ways to manage their emotions and to react to upsetting
situations appropriately. Family therapy may also be recommended to help improve family interactions and to
educate family members about the disorder, enabling them to better support the child.

**Eating Disorders**

Eating disorders are serious and often fatal illnesses that are associated with severe disturbances in people’s
eating behaviors and related thoughts and emotions. Preoccupation with food, body weight, and shape may also
signal an eating disorder. Common eating disorders include anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating
disorder. These disorders can significantly impact physical health and may interfere with daily life activities.

**Signs and Symptoms**

Common signs and symptoms across different eating disorders include:
» Extreme concern with body weight and shape
» Abnormal eating habits such as severely restricting food intake or eating very large amounts
» Emotional distress or extreme concern about body weight or shape
» In more severe cases, eating disorders can cause serious health consequences and may even result in
death if not treated.

**Sub-types of the Disorder**

Eating disorders can be categorized into several distinct types, each with unique signs and symptoms:
» **Anorexia Nervosa**: Characterized by weight loss (or lack of appropriate weight gain in growing children);
difficulties maintaining an appropriate body weight for height, age, and stature; and, in many individuals,
distorted body image. People with anorexia generally restrict the number of calories and the types of food
they eat.
» **Bulimia Nervosa**: Involves periods of eating unusually large amounts of food followed by behaviors to
prevent weight gain, such as forced vomiting, excessive use of laxatives or diuretics, fasting, excessive
