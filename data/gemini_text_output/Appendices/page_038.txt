as bupropion or varenicline) can be an effective component of treatment when part of a comprehensive
behavioral treatment program.

8. An individual's treatment and services plan must be assessed continually and modified as necessary to
ensure that it meets his or her changing needs. A patient may require varying combinations of services
and treatment components during the course of treatment. and recovery. In addition to counseling or
psychotherapy, a patient may require medication, medical services, family therapy, parenting instruction,
vocational rehabilitation, and/or social and legal services. For many patients, a continuing care approach
provides the best results, with the treatment intensity varying according to a person's changing needs.

9. Many drug-addicted individuals also have other mental disorders. Because drug abuse and addiction—
both of which are mental disorders—often co-occur with other mental illnesses, patients presenting with
one condition should be assessed for the other(s). And when these problems co- occur, treatment should
address both (or all), including the use of medications as appropriate.

10. Medically assisted detoxification is only the first stage of addiction treatment and by itself does little to
change long-term drug abuse. Although medically assisted detoxification can safely manage the acute
physical symptoms of withdrawal and can, for some, pave the way for effective long-term addiction
treatment, detoxification alone is rarely sufficient to help addicted individuals achieve long-term
abstinence. Thus, patients should be encouraged to continue drug treatment following detoxification.
Motivational enhancement and incentive strategies, begun at initial patient intake, can improve treatment
engagement.

11. Treatment does not need to be voluntary to be effective. Sanctions or enticements from family,
employment settings, and/or the criminal justice system can significantly increase treatment entry,
retention rates, and the ultimate success of drug treatment interventions.

12. Drug use during treatment must be monitored continuously, as lapses during treatment do occur.
Knowing their drug use is being monitored can be a powerful incentive for patients and can help them
withstand urges to use drugs. Monitoring also provides an early indication of a return to drug use,
signaling a possible need to adjust an individual's treatment plan to better meet his or her needs.

13. Treatment programs should test patients for the presence of HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B and C, tuberculosis,
and other infectious diseases as well as provide targeted risk-reduction counseling, linking patients to
treatment if necessary. Typically, SUD treatment addresses some of the drug-related behaviors that put
people at risk of infectious diseases. Targeted counseling focused on reducing infectious disease risk can
help patients further reduce or avoid substance-related and other high-risk behaviors. Counseling can
also help those who are already infected to manage their illness. Moreover, engaging in SUD treatment
can facilitate adherence to other medical treatments. Substance abuse treatment facilities should provide
onsite, rapid HIV testing rather than referrals to offsite testing—research shows that doing so increases
the likelihood that patients will be tested and receive their test results. Treatment providers should also
inform patients that highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has proven effective in combating HIV,
including among drug-abusing populations, and help link them to HIV treatment if they test positive.
