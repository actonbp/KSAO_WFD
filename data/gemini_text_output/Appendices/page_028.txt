    › Negative feelings about yourself or other people

    › Hopelessness about the future

    › Trouble sleeping
    › Trouble concentrating

    › Overwhelming feelings of guilt or shame

**Sub-types of the Disorder**

While PTSD is generally considered as a single disorder, it can manifest in different forms, depending on the
intensity, duration, and nature of the symptoms:

» **Acute Stress Disorder (ASD)**: Occurs immediately after the traumatic event, lasting from three days to
one month.
» **Complex PTSD**: Seen in individuals who have experienced prolonged or repeated trauma, such as
domestic violence, abuse, or war.

**Medications Used to Treat the Disorder**

Medications are often used in combination with psychotherapy to treat PTSD. The most common types of
medications prescribed include:

» **Antidepressants**: Particularly SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) like sertraline and
paroxetine, which can help alleviate symptoms of depression and anxiety.
» **Prazosin**: If symptoms include insomnia or recurrent nightmares, this medication might be helpful.
» **Anti-anxiety medications**: Occasionally used to relieve severe anxiety and related problems, though
typically for short-term relief due to the risk of dependency.

Psychotherapy is a core component of treatment for PTSD. Effective modalities include cognitive-behavioral
therapy (CBT), which involves exposure therapy to help people face and control their fear by gradually exposing
them to the trauma they experienced in a safe way, and Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing
(EMDR), which involves processing distressing memories and changing the negative reactions to them.

**Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD)**

Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD) is a relatively new classification of mood disorder defined
to address the symptoms of chronic, severe and persistent irritability in children that does not fit the criteria
for bipolar disorder. DMDD is characterized by extreme difficulty in regulating emotions, which manifests as
intense temper outbursts at an intensity or duration that is disproportionate to the situation or provocation.
These outbursts can occur three or more times a week and are combined with a persistently irritable or angry
mood almost every day. This condition is typically diagnosed in children between the ages of 6 and 18.
