exercise, or a combination of these behaviors.
» **Binge-Eating Disorder:** Similar to bulimia nervosa, but without regular use of purging, fasting, or excessive exercise. Individuals with binge-eating disorder are often overweight or obese.

**Medications Used to Treat the Disorder**

Medications are not the sole treatment for eating disorders as these conditions often require a comprehensive treatment plan including nutrition, education, psychotherapy, and medical and psychiatric monitoring. Commonly used medications include:
» **Antidepressants**: Often prescribed to help with symptoms of anxiety and depression that frequently co-occur with eating disorders. SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) are most commonly used.
» **Antipsychotics**: May be used, especially in severe cases of anorexia, to treat distorted thinking and reduce obsessive behaviors.
» **Mood Stabilizers**: Used in some cases to stabilize mood swings associated with eating disorders.

Comprehensive treatment aims to restore adequate nutrition, bring weight to a healthy level, reduce excessive exercise, and treat the psychological issues related to the eating disorder. This often involves a team approach, including primary care doctors, mental health professionals, and dietitians, all with experience in eating disorders.

**Schizophrenia**

Schizophrenia is a chronic and severe mental disorder that affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves. People with schizophrenia may seem like they have lost touch with reality, which can be distressing for them and for those around them. The disorder is characterized by episodes of psychosis, involving delusions and hallucinations, and periods of reduced engagement with the external world. Schizophrenia is not as common as other mental disorders, but the symptoms can be very disabling.

**Signs and Symptoms**

The symptoms of schizophrenia are generally divided into three categories: positive, negative, and cognitive.

**Positive symptoms** (added experiences):
» Hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that are not there)
» Delusions (false beliefs not based in reality)
» Thought disorders (unusual or dysfunctional ways of thinking)
» Movement disorders (agitated body movements)

**Negative symptoms** (capabilities that are reduced):
» Reduced expression of emotions in the face and voice
» Reduced feelings of pleasure in everyday life
» Difficulty beginning and sustaining activities
» Reduced speaking

**Cognitive symptoms** (affecting memory and other aspects of thinking):
» Poor executive functioning (the ability to understand information and use it to make decisions)
» Trouble focusing or paying attention
