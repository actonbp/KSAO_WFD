**Medications Used to Treat the Disorder**

Medications are not typically used as the primary treatment for personality disorders but may be prescribed to help with specific troubling and debilitating symptoms. For instance:
» **Antidepressants** may be used to treat symptoms of depression, anger, or irritability, which can occur with many personality disorders.
» **Mood Stabilizers** can help flatten mood swings or reduce irritability, impulsivity, and aggression.
» **Antipsychotic Medications** may be helpful for those with symptoms that include loss of touch with reality (psychosis), such as occurs in schizotypal personality disorder.
» **Anti-anxiety Medications** can help relieve the anxiety, agitation, and insomnia that often accompany these disorders.

Treatment for personality disorders typically involves long-term psychotherapy with a psychologist or psychiatrist and, sometimes, medications to treat distressing symptoms associated with the disorder or co-occurring problems, such as depression or anxiety.

**Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)**

Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a chronic mental health condition characterized by uncontrollable, recurring thoughts (obsessions) and behaviors (compulsions) that the individual feels the urge to repeat over and over. These obsessions and compulsions interfere with daily activities and cause significant distress. The person may try to ignore or stop the obsessions, but this only increases their distress and anxiety, leading them to perform ritualistic behaviors to reduce the anxiety.

**Signs and Symptoms**

Symptoms of OCD can vary but generally include both obsessions and compulsions.

**Obsessions are repeated thoughts, urges, or mental images that cause anxiety. Common symptoms include:**
» Fear of germs or contamination
» Unwanted forbidden or taboo thoughts involving sex, religion, or harm
» Aggressive thoughts towards others or self
» Having things symmetrical or in a perfect order
