**Medications Used to Treat the Disorder**

Treatment for depressive disorders often involves medications, including:
» **Antidepressants**: Medications that are commonly used to treat depressive disorders include SSRIs
   (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline), SNRIs (e.g., venlafaxine, duloxetine), and other groups like tricyclic
   antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).
» **Mood Stabilizers**: Particularly useful in bipolar disorder, such as lithium and certain anticonvulsants.
» **Atypical Antipsychotics**: Sometimes used in conjunction with antidepressants for major depressive
   disorder or bipolar disorder.

Depression, even the most severe cases, can be treated. The earlier treatment begins, the more effective it is.
Depression is usually treated with psychotherapy, medication, or a combination of the two. Various medications
work differently and can be highly effective when closely monitored by a healthcare provider to manage potential
side effects and ensure the best treatment response. Some people experience treatment-resistant depression,
which occurs when a person does not get better after trying at least two antidepressant medications. In this case
or the need for rapid relief from symptoms is urgent, brain stimulation therapy may be an option to explore.

**BIPOLAR DISORDER**

Bipolar disorder, also known as bipolar affective disorder, involves significant changes in mood, energy, and
activity levels that can affect a person’s ability to carry out day-to-day tasks. These changes range from periods
of extremely “up” and energized behavior (known as manic episodes) to very sad, “down,” or hopeless periods
(known as depressive episodes). Less severe manic periods are known as hypomanic episodes. Bipolar disorder is
a lifelong condition that can be managed with proper treatment.
