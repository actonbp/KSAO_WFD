9. Effectively treating substance use disorders in adolescents requires also identifying and treating any
other mental health conditions they may have. Adolescents who abuse drugs frequently also suffer from
other conditions including depression, anxiety disorders, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),
oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct problems. Adolescents who abuse drugs, particularly those
involved in the juvenile justice system, should be screened for other psychiatric disorders. Treatment for
these problems should be integrated with the treatment for a substance use disorder.

10. Sensitive issues such as violence and child abuse or risk of suicide should be identified and addressed.
Many adolescents who abuse drugs have a history of physical, emotional, and/or sexual abuse or other
trauma. If abuse is suspected, referrals should be made to social and protective services, following local
regulations and reporting requirements.

11. It is important to monitor drug use during treatment. Adolescents recovering from substance use
disorders may experience relapse, or a return to drug use. Triggers associated with relapse vary and can
include mental stress and social situations linked with prior drug use. It is important to identify a return
to drug use early before an undetected relapse progresses to more serious consequences. A relapse signals
the need for more treatment or a need to adjust the individual’s current treatment plan to better meet his
or her needs.

12. Staying in treatment for an adequate period of time and continuity of care afterward are important.
The minimal length of drug treatment depends on the type and extent of the adolescent’s problems,
but studies show outcomes are better when a person stays in treatment for 3 months or more. Because
relapses often occur, more than one episode of treatment may be necessary. Many adolescents also
benefit from continuing care following treatment, including drug use monitoring, follow-up visits at
home, and linking the family to other needed services.

13. Testing adolescents for sexually transmitted diseases like HIV, as well as hepatitis B and C, is an
important part of drug treatment. Adolescents who use drugs—whether injecting or non-injecting—are
at an increased risk for diseases that are transmitted sexually as well as through the blood, including HIV
and hepatitis B and C. All drugs of abuse alter judgment and decision making, increasing the likelihood
that an adolescent will engage in unprotected sex and other high-risk behaviors including sharing
contaminated drug injection equipment and unsafe tattooing and body piercing practices—potential
routes of virus transmission. Substance use treatment can reduce this risk both by reducing adolescents’
drug use (and thus keeping them out of situations in which they are not thinking clearly) and by
providing risk-reduction counseling to help them modify or change their high-risk behaviors.
