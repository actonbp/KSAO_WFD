APPENDICES 421

**Compulsions are repetitive behaviors that a person with OCD feels the urge to do in response to an obsessive thought. Common compulsions include:**
» Excessive cleaning and/or handwashing
» Ordering and arranging things in a particular, precise way
» Repeatedly checking on things, such as repeatedly checking to see if the door is locked
» Compulsive counting

**Sub-types of the Disorder**

While OCD is generally considered a single disorder, it can manifest in various forms, depending on the nature of the obsessions and compulsions. Some sub-types include:
» **Contamination Obsessions with Cleaning Compulsions:** Fear of contamination leads to excessive cleaning rituals.
» **Symmetry Obsessions with Ordering/Arranging Compulsions:** Need for things to be symmetrical or in perfect order, leading to arranging rituals.
» **Harm Obsessions with Checking Compulsions:** Fear that failure to check things will lead to harm or disaster.
» **Forbidden Thoughts Obsessions with Related Compulsions:** Involves obsessions with aggressive, sexual, or religious thoughts and related compulsive behaviors to neutralize these thoughts.

**Medications Used to Treat the Disorder**

Treatment often includes a combination of medication and psychotherapy. Common medications used are:
» **Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs):** These are the medications most commonly used to manage OCD. They may help reduce obsessions and compulsions. Examples include fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and sertraline.
» **Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs):** In some cases, particularly when SSRIs are ineffective, TCAs like clomipramine may be prescribed. Clomipramine is specifically approved for treating OCD and is often considered particularly effective, though it may have more side effects than SSRIs.

Psychotherapy, especially cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and specifically Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP), is considered the most effective means of reducing compulsive behaviors. This involves gradual exposure to the source of the individual's obsession and learning to refrain from compulsive behavior intended to reduce anxiety.

**Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)**

Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition triggered by experiencing or witnessing a terrifying event. Symptoms may include flashbacks, nightmares, severe anxiety, and uncontrollable thoughts about the event. Many people who go through traumatic events may have temporary difficulty adjusting and coping, but with time and good self-care, they usually get better. However, if the symptoms worsen, last for months or even years, and interfere with day-to-day functioning, they may have PTSD. Getting effective treatment after PTSD symptoms develop can be critical in reducing symptoms and improving function.

**Signs and Symptoms**

Symptoms of PTSD are generally grouped into four types:

» **Intrusive memories,** which may include:
    › Recurrent, unwanted distressing memories of the traumatic event
    › Reliving the traumatic event as if it were happening again (flashbacks)
    › Upsetting dreams or nightmares about the traumatic event
    › Severe emotional distress or physical reactions to something that reminds you of the traumatic event
