**APPENDIX C.**
**MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS**

Mental health disorders encompass a wide range of conditions that affect mood, thinking, behavior, and
perception. These disorders can significantly impact a person’s ability to function in daily life, influencing
relationships, work, and overall well-being. From common disorders like anxiety and depression to more
complex conditions like schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders, each mental health issue presents unique
challenges. Understanding the signs, symptoms, and treatments associated with each disorder is crucial for
effective management and care.

Mental health disorders are largely a result of problems or mistakes in how the brain functions in individuals
and what is happening in their brain chemistry. Mental health disorders can be very mild and have very little
impact on the person’s life, or they can be very severe, causing the person with the disorder to become disabled
and unable to carry on with their normal activities. How mental health disorders show up in individuals is
different for children than it is for adults; different for males and females; and can be different for different races
and different cultures.

Specific symptoms define mental health disorders and help lead to a correct diagnosis. The symptoms can
vary from person to person, even if the diagnosis is the same. People may have high anxiety, have problems
in thinking clearly, have distorted perceptions of the world around them, or have problems controlling their
behavior. Making a proper diagnosis of the type of mental health disorder a person is experiencing is very
important because it helps to determine what type of treatment the person will need.

Medications can play an important role in treating mental health disorders. They are often used in combination
with other treatments, such as psychotherapy and brain stimulation therapy. Medications can affect people in
different ways, and it may take several tries to find the medication that works best with the fewest side effects.
It’s important to work with a health care provider or a mental health professional to develop a treatment plan
that meets a client’s individual needs and medical situation.

Information about medications is updated frequently. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has
Medication Guides with the latest information, warnings, and approved medications. MedlinePlus also provides
information on drugs, herbs, and supplements, including side effects and warnings. In addition, the National
Institute on Mental Health (NIMH) maintains an entire section of their website on mental health disorders and
medications used for treatment.

This appendix provides an overview of the most diagnosed mental health disorders, offering insights into their
characteristics and the types of medications used to address them.
