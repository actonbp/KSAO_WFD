**Sub-types of the Disorder**

ADHD is typically categorized into three subtypes, which are:
» **Predominantly Inattentive Presentation:** The individual mainly has symptoms of inattention and is easily distracted but doesn’t really have issues with hyperactivity.
» **Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Presentation:** The individual mainly shows hyperactive and impulsive behaviors, including restlessness and difficulty waiting their turn.
» **Combined Presentation:** Symptoms of both inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity are equally present in the person.

**Medications Used to Treat the Disorder**

Treatment for ADHD typically involves medications, education or training, therapy, or a combination of treatments. The medications commonly used include:
» **Stimulants:** The most common type of medication used for treating ADHD. These drugs help control impulsive behavior and increase attention span. Examples include methylphenidate and amphetamines.
» **Non-stimulants:** Used for individuals who do not respond well to stimulants. They may take longer to start working than stimulants, but they can also improve focus, attention, and impulsivity in a person with ADHD. An example is atomoxetine.
» **Antidepressants:** Occasionally used for treating ADHD, particularly in individuals with co-occurring depression or anxiety.

Behavioral therapy, including psychoeducation, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and social skills training, plays a key role in treating ADHD, especially in children, to help improve behavior, self-control, and self-esteem.

**Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD)**

Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) encompass a range of neurodevelopmental conditions characterized by challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviors, speech, and nonverbal communication. The effects of ASD and the severity of symptoms are different in each person. ASD is known as a "spectrum" disorder because there is wide variation in the type and severity of symptoms people experience. ASD is typically evident by the age of two or three and can be diagnosed as early as 18 months or younger. Early intervention and support can significantly improve a child's development.

**Signs and Symptoms**

Common signs and symptoms of autism spectrum disorders include:
» Difficulties in social interaction, such as difficulty understanding and maintaining relationships
» Challenges with communication, including delays in language development or non-verbal communication behaviors like eye contact and facial expressions
» Repetitive behaviors or strict adherence to specific routines or behaviors
» Hyper- or hypo-reactivity to sensory input (e.g., adverse reactions to certain sounds, textures, or lights and fascination with lights or spinning objects)
» Unusual focus on pieces of toys (e.g., wheels of a toy car) rather than the whole toy

**Sub-types of the Disorder**

Previously, ASD included several distinct disorders, such as autistic disorder, pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), and Asperger syndrome. With the latest edition of the *Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5-TR)*, these subtypes have been merged into one umbrella diagnosis of ASD.
