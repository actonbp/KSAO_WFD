**Mood Disorders**

Mood disorders are a category of mental health conditions characterized by significant changes in mood that disrupt daily life. These changes can manifest as periods of intense sadness or excessively high and euphoric moods, or sometimes both, affecting a person's ability to function. Mood disorders not only affect emotions but also energy levels, sleep patterns, appetite, and overall health. The two primary types of mood disorders are depressive disorders and bipolar disorders, each involving different types of mood disturbances.

**DEPRESSIVE DISORDERS**

Depressive disorders are a category of mood disorders that involve persistent feelings of sadness and a lack of interest in external activities. They can significantly impair daily functioning. Unlike normal emotional experiences of sadness, grief, or low energy, depressive disorders are persistent and can dramatically interfere with a person's ability to function. People with depressive disorders might struggle with their daily work, sleep, eating, and enjoyment of life. These disorders might occur only once in a lifetime but more commonly occur repeatedly.

**Signs and Symptoms**

Symptoms of depressive disorders can include:
» Persistent feelings of sadness, anxiety, or emptiness
» Feelings of hopelessness or pessimism
» Irritability
» Feelings of guilt, worthlessness, or helplessness
» Loss of interest or pleasure in hobbies and activities
» Decreased energy or fatigue
» Moving or talking more slowly
» Difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions
» Trouble sleeping, early-morning awakening, or oversleeping
» Appetite and/or weight changes
» Thoughts of death or suicide, or suicide attempts
» Aches or pains, headaches, cramps, or digestive problems without a clear physical cause and/or that do not ease even with treatment

**Sub-types of the Disorder**

Several types of depressive disorders commonly recognized include:
» **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD):** Characterized by severe depressive symptoms that interfere with a person's ability to work, sleep, study, eat, and enjoy life. An episode can occur only once in a person's lifetime, but more often, a person has several episodes.
» **Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia):** A chronic form of depression where a person's mood is regularly low. However, symptoms are not as severe as in major depression.
» **Postpartum Depression:** Not just the typical “baby blues,” this includes extreme feelings of sadness, anxiety, and exhaustion that can interfere with a new mother's ability to care for herself or her family.
» **Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD):** A type of depression that's related to changes in seasons, typically starting in the late fall and early winter and going away during the spring and summer.
» **Bipolar Disorder:** Although not strictly classified as a depressive disorder, it involves significant mood episodes, ranging from extremes of high energy with an “up” mood (mania) to low depressive periods.
