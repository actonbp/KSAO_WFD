**Anxiety Disorders**

Anxiety disorders are a group of mental health conditions that cause excessive fear or anxiety. Unlike the
relatively mild and brief anxiety caused by a stressful event (such as speaking in public or a first date), anxiety
disorders last at least six months and can worsen if not treated. They often affect daily functioning, making it
hard to complete tasks at work, school, or in social settings due to persistent worry or fear. These disorders are
among the most common mental health conditions worldwide and can vary greatly in severity.

**Signs and Symptoms**

Common symptoms of anxiety disorders include:
» Feelings of nervousness, restlessness, or being tense
» A sense of impending danger, panic, or doom
» Increased heart rate
» Rapid breathing, or hyperventilation
» Sweating
» Trembling
» Feeling weak or tired
» Difficulty concentrating or thinking about anything other than the present worry
» Having trouble sleeping
» Experiencing gastrointestinal (GI) problems

**Sub-types of the Disorder**

There are several major types of anxiety disorders, each with its own characteristics:
» **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD):** Characterized by chronic anxiety, exaggerated worry, and tension,
even when there is little or nothing to provoke it.
» **Panic Disorder:** Involves recurrent, unexpected panic attacks and fear of experiencing another episode.
» **Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia):** Involves overwhelming worry and self-consciousness about
everyday social situations.
» **Specific Phobias:** An intense fear of a specific object or situation, such as heights or flying.
» **Agoraphobia:** Fear of being in situations where escape might be difficult or that help wouldn't be
available if things go wrong.
» **Separation Anxiety Disorder:** Fear of being away from home or loved ones.

**Medications Used to Treat the Disorder**

Medications are often used in conjunction with therapy to treat anxiety disorders. Common types of medication
include:
» **Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs):** Often the first line of medication prescribed for anxiety,
SSRIs like fluoxetine and sertraline can help reduce symptoms of anxiety.
» **Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs):** Medications such as venlafaxine and duloxetine
are also effective in treating anxiety by increasing levels of serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain.
» **Benzodiazepines:** These drugs can help relieve anxiety symptoms quickly but are generally used for
short-term relief due to the risk of dependency.

These medications can be very effective but often come with side effects and risks, so it's important for
individuals to work closely with their healthcare provider to find the most appropriate treatment for their
specific needs.
