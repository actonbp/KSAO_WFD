APPENDICES 427

There are no medications that can cure ASD or treat the core symptoms. However, certain medications can help manage specific symptoms such as irritability, aggression, repetitive behavior, hyperactivity, anxiety, and attention problems. Common medications include:
» **Antipsychotics**: Such as risperidone and aripiprazole, which are the only FDA-approved medications for children with autism to help reduce irritability and aggression.
» **Stimulants and Non-stimulants**: Used to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms, which are common in individuals with ASD.
» **Antidepressants**: Sometimes prescribed to manage symptoms of anxiety and depression that can co-occur with autism.

Alongside medication, behavioral therapies and interventions are central to managing ASD. These can include behavioral therapy, speech and language therapy, and occupational therapy, which help improve communication, social skills, and physical coordination. Early, intensive, and individualized treatment has been shown to be effective in enhancing the functional abilities of children with ASD.

**Note: Substance Use Disorders** also belongs on this list. It is not listed since the other chapters in this study guide have SUDs as the focus.
