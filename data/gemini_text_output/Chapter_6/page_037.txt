CHAPTER 6: Evidence-based Practices 299

not to engage in counseling. Counseling should not be a requirement to receive medications to support recovery.

SUD counselors can start by addressing the stigmatization and misunderstanding of MAT, which is often perceived as secondary to psychosocial interventions or just a continuance of “addiction” with another drug. SUD counselors must possess a thorough understanding of MAT actions, risks, and uses to advocate effectively for its inclusion in treatment plans. They have a responsibility to educate clients about the benefits and limitations of MAT, addressing misconceptions, and providing a supportive environment conducive to recovery. Here a few additional examples of how SUD counselors can support MAT:

» They can provide crucial education to clients and their family members on the various types and
effectiveness of MAT, to demystify its use and foster acceptance of these as a viable method for treating a
chronic OUD/AUD.

» They can help clients overcome challenges they face in obtaining MAT, such as troubleshooting issues
related to the client’s ability to pay for OUD/AUD medication or facilitating subsidized transportation to
get to prescriber appointments.

» They can help women who have OUD/AUD prepare for a safe and healthy pregnancy by offering
information about how OUD/AUD can affect the baby, options for effective OUD/AUD treatment, and other
steps they can take to support a healthy pregnancy. They can educate women and their family members
on:
    › The benefits and risks of continuing MAT for an OUD/AUD during pregnancy.
    › The need for ongoing prenatal care.
    › The potential for the baby to develop NOWS, including how this condition can be treated and
      managed.
    › Available recovery supports, including counseling and other services that may be helpful to address
      any housing- or food-related needs.110

Overall, SUD counselors are integral to the successful implementation of medication-assisted treatments,
offering a holistic approach that supports medications with counseling and psychosocial support to address the
unique needs of each client.

**OPIOID OVERDOSE PREVENTION - NALOXONE**111, 112

**Naloxone** is a medication approved by the FDA designed to rapidly
reverse opioid overdose. It is an opioid receptor antagonist—meaning
that it binds to opioid receptors and can reverse and block the effects
of other opioids, such as heroin, morphine, and oxycodone. Giving
naloxone rapidly reverses the effects of opioid drugs, restoring normal
respiration. The medication can be given by intranasal spray (into the
nose), intramuscular (into the muscle), subcutaneous (under the skin), or
intravenous injection. It is a temporary treatment and its effects do not
last long. Therefore, it is critical to obtain medical intervention as soon as
possible after administering or receiving naloxone.

The use of naloxone is a **harm reduction strategy for overdose
prevention**. Overdose prevention includes taking steps to reduce the risk
of overdose in the first place, responding to an overdose by administering
naloxone or other opioid overdose reversal medications, and referring the
person to harm reduction services and supports.

**Harm Reduction** is an evidence-
based, practical, and transformative
approach that incorporates public
health strategies—including
prevention, risk reduction, and
health promotion—to empower
people who use drugs (PWUD)
and their families with the choice
to live healthier, self-directed, and
purpose-filled lives. Harm reduction
centers the lived and living
experience of PWUD, especially
those in under-served communities,
in these strategies and the practices
that flow from them.
