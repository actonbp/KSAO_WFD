3. **Automatic Thoughts:** CBT emphasizes the role of automatic thoughts, which are spontaneous, often unnoticed thoughts that can have a significant impact on mood and behavior. These thoughts can be irrational or negative and are considered a key target for intervention in CBT. For example, “If I refuse to use Molly with my friends, they won’t like me or think I am a wuss.”³⁰

CBT suggests that dysfunctional schemas can lead to persistent negative thought patterns and behaviors. Counseling may involve identifying and challenging these core beliefs to effect change.

Alongside this technique, CBT also incorporates behavioral techniques to change patterns of behavior that maintain or worsen substance use or psychological problems. This includes techniques like exposure therapy for anxiety disorders, where individuals gradually confront their fears, or behavioral activation for depression, which encourages engagement in enjoyable activities.

6. **Empowerment through Skill Development:** CBT empowers individuals by teaching them coping skills for dealing with different types of psychological distress. These skills include problem-solving, assertiveness training, mindfulness, and relaxation techniques. The aim is for individuals' have the ability to apply these skills as needed to manage future challenges.

8. **Goal Orientation and Collaborative Nature:** CBT is goal-oriented and collaborative. Counseling sessions have a structure and focus on achieving specific outcomes. The counselor and client work together to identify goals, explore and understand problems, and develop strategies for overcoming them.

9. **Adaptability and Flexibility:** While CBT has a set of core principles, it is also adaptable to the individual needs of the client. Counselors can tailor the approach to address the specific problems and goals of each individual, making it flexible and personalized.

**COGNITIVE RESTRUCTURING**

A fundamental technique in CBT is called cognitive restructuring. Cognitive restructuring aims to identify, challenge, and ultimately alter maladaptive, distorted, or negative thought patterns (cognitive distortions) that contribute to psychological distress. This process involves several steps:³¹

1. **Identification of Maladaptive Thoughts:** The first step in cognitive restructuring is to help individuals become aware of their automatic thoughts—the spontaneous, often critical, and negative thoughts that arise in response to specific situations. These thoughts are usually accepted as true by the individual, despite being based on assumptions or misconceptions.

2. **Evaluation of Thoughts:** Once these thoughts are identified, the individual is encouraged to evaluate them critically, assessing their accuracy and helpfulness. This might involve looking for evidence that supports or contradicts these thoughts, considering alternative interpretations of the situation, or assessing the likelihood of feared outcomes happening.

3. **Challenge Distorted Thoughts:** The counselor and client work together to challenge the validity of distorted or irrational thoughts. This might involve questioning the evidence for these thoughts, examining their logical basis, or testing their validity through experimentation or observation.

4. **Development of Alternative Thoughts:** After challenging the maladaptive thoughts, the next step is to develop more balanced, realistic thoughts to replace them. These alternative thoughts are based on a more accurate assessment of the situation and are typically less extreme and more flexible than the original thoughts.
