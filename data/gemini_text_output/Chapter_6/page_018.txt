**MINDFULNESS-BASED APPROACHES⁴⁷**

Helping clients develop proactive strategies
and improve their emotional regulation skills
is an important component of recovery.
Research indicates that stress—and how
an individual responds to stressors—can
be significant factors both in developing
problematic substance use and in recurrence.
As noted in Chapter 1, researchers have
identified certain aspects of the brain’s
response to stress that can predispose a
person to substance use and to the effects
that continued substance use can have on
executive function, decision making, and
inhibition control, which are factors that can
lead to recurrence.

**Mindfulness is a meditative coping strategy
that can increase a person’s ability to manage
stress and enhance emotional regulation.**
Mindfulness falls into the category of coping
skill strategies. Although mindfulness has its
origins in Eastern meditation and spiritual
traditions, Western treatment methods
have widely adapted it for recovery from
problematic substance use, SUDs and MHDs,
such as anxiety, depression, eating disorders,
PTSD, and borderline personality disorder. In
addition, mindfulness-based interventions
are culturally sensitive and have shown
promise with racial and ethnic minorities
and women.⁴⁸ Various approaches for treating
problematic substance use and preventing
recurrence feature mindfulness practices,
including Acceptance and Commitment
therapy (ACT), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), Mindfulness-based Relapse Prevention (MBRP), and
Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (MBSR). Mindfulness can help people manage cravings and urges, decrease
the likelihood of recurrence of depression and other mental health issues, and lower the desire to use substances
in response to negative emotions and cognitions.⁴⁹ Qualities of mindfulness include:

» Feeling alert but relaxed.
» Nonjudgmental awareness of the present moment.
» Kindness and compassion.
» Curiosity and acceptance about distressing or uncomfortable thoughts or sensations.

In practice, mindfulness is nonjudgmental, present-moment awareness of thoughts, mental images, feelings,
physical sensations, urges, and impulses. Mindfulness can be learned in formal meditation or practiced through
greater awareness of everyday activities, such as eating, walking, washing dishes, or folding clothes. Developing
the traits of mindfulness can enhance a person’s ability to observe (or **witness**) thoughts, feelings, and
sensations without acting on them impulsively.

The person appears to be in a meditative pose, with their right hand visible, forming a mudra (thumb and index finger touching). The background is a lighter, out-of-focus natural scene, possibly a landscape with hills. The lighting creates a strong contrast between the dark silhouette and the lighter background.]
