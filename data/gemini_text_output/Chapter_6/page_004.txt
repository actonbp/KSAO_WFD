**BEHAVIORAL TREATMENTS -**
**MOTIVATIONAL INTERVIEWING**

Motivational approaches, particularly **Motivational Interviewing (MI)**, have been extensively applied across a spectrum of SUD treatments, offering a flexible and effective strategy for engaging clients in behavior change. The use of motivational approaches shows the shift towards more empathetic, client-centered care. By focusing on the individual’s motivations and strengths, these approaches not only help with engagement and retention in treatment but also empower clients to take active roles in their recovery.

Motivational Interviewing (MI) is a client-centered, directive method for enhancing personal motivation to change by exploring and resolving ambivalence.¹⁰ MI began in substance use treatment in the early 1980’s. At that time, the prevailing view and strategy in addressing problematic substance use was one of confrontation as an “intervention.” The introduction of MI was truly an innovation because it created a shift in the underlying philosophy of care. This motivational approach has been proven over the last three decades to have more lasting effects than the intervention method. Helping professionals are drawn to MI for a variety of reasons:

1. The aspects, principles, and values of MI are like those that guide and are embraced by a wide range of helping professionals.

2. MI has a rich body of evidence that supports its use with populations at risk and individuals seeking mental health and substance use disorder treatment.

3. MI has been found to be effective in clients from diverse backgrounds and settings and seems to fit well with concepts of cultural competency.¹¹

4. MI is a flexible approach as a stand-alone or in combination with other interventions.¹²

MI is more than the use of a set of technical interventions. It is characterized by a particular “spirit” or “way of being” with others which is the context or interpersonal relationship within which the techniques are employed. Central to the spirit of MI is having an attitude of **acceptance** of what the individual brings to the table.

MI is a useful approach when: 1) a person is ambivalent about change; 2) the focus is on building trust and rapport; 3) part of one’s job involves encouraging and supporting others in making changes; and, 4) the job involves working with people who might be referred to as being “difficult” or “resistant to change.”¹³ In Chapter 4, the concept of ambivalence was introduced. As a reminder – **ambivalence** refers to the mixed feelings or conflicting attitudes a person has towards change. It is a central concept in MI, reflecting the natural human experience of being torn between continuing a certain behavior and the desire to change that behavior. Ambivalence is viewed not as a barrier to change, but as a normal and expected aspect of the change process.

Ambivalence is seen as something to be explored and resolved through therapeutic **conversations**. MI is fundamentally a conversation about change. Counselors use MI techniques to help clients examine their ambivalent feelings. The goal is to assist clients in moving towards resolving their ambivalence in favor of change that aligns with their deeper values and goals. Understanding and addressing ambivalence is crucial in MI, as it directly influences a person’s motivation and readiness to change. By acknowledging and working through ambivalence, MI facilitates a supportive environment where clients can find their own motivation for making meaningful changes in their lives.
