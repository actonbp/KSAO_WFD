CHAPTER 6: Evidence-based Practices 279

reciprocal communication. Validation strategies are used to communicate
what the client is thinking and feeling, and to demonstrate acceptance of
the client’s efforts to change problematic behaviors. The purpose of these
acceptance practices is to help the client learn how to both self-validate
as well as tolerate their current experiences more effectively.³⁵ These
strategies are also designed to help both counselor and client accept one’s
life and present moment and become the focus of treatment.³⁶

The goal of DBT is to help clients develop a life worth living. DBT is
a comprehensive outpatient therapy with five functions designed to
help a client reach this goal: 1) improving motivation of the client to
change problem behaviors, 2) enhancing capabilities, 3) generalizing
new adaptive behavior to relevant life contexts, 4) structuring the
client’s environment to support new adaptive behavior, and 5) improving
motivation and capabilities of therapists. Therapeutic actions are
structured around: mindfulness, distress tolerance, emotion regulation,
and interpersonal effectiveness. Goals are to improve clients’ ability
to manage emotional distress, reduce self-destructive behaviors, and
enhance relationships. The modes of treatment in DBT, designed to
explicitly meet the five functions, include weekly individual counseling,
weekly skills training sessions, phone coaching as needed, and weekly
consultation with a team.³⁸ When DBT is successful, clients learn to
envision, articulate, pursue, and sustain goals that are independent of
their history of out-of-control behavior, including problematic substance
use, and are better able to grapple with life’s ordinary problems.³⁹ DBT’s
emphasis on building a life worth living is a broader therapeutic goal that
is consistent with recovery-oriented principles.

“Dialectical” is a puzzling word. According to the Oxford dictionary,
dialectical means - discovering the truth of ideas by discussion and
logical argument and by considering ideas that are opposed to each
other.⁴⁰ Dialectical philosophy is a method of philosophical argument
that emphasizes the process of contradiction and its resolution, which is
characterized by the tension between opposing forces, ideas, or elements.
This approach highlights the idea that conflict and contradiction are inherent in all things and that change and
development result from the struggle between opposing elements.⁴¹ In DBT, the synthesis of opposing forces is
central to fostering change and growth in individuals.

The DBT principles of behavioral science, acceptance, and dialectical philosophy are considered universal;
therefore, DBT is well-situated to be tailored to clients’ cultural contexts in application while remaining
adherent to the theories and values that are at the foundation of DBT.⁴²,⁴³ In addition, research has demonstrated
DBT’s efficacy across a variety of settings and populations, including individuals with substance use disorders⁴⁴,
eating disorders, depression, and ADHD, among others.⁴⁵,⁴⁶ Additional evidence-based practices that use CBT as a
foundation can be found in the Mindfulness-based Approaches and Trauma Approaches sections in this chapter.
