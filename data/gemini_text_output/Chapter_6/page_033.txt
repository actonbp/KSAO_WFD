CHAPTER 6: Evidence-based Practices 295

**BUPRENORPHINE**

Buprenorphine is a partial opioid agonist. It produces effects such as
euphoria or respiratory depression at a lower potential than full agonists
like heroin or methadone. Its unique pharmacological properties make it
an essential component MAT, helping individuals reduce or quit their use
of opioids. Buprenorphine binds to the brain’s opioid receptors, partially
stimulating them to alleviate withdrawal symptoms and cravings without
producing the full opioid effect. This action reduces the risk of misuse,
dependency, and side effects. Additionally, buprenorphine has a “ceiling
effect,” meaning that its effects plateau at a certain dose, decreasing the
risk of overdose.

Buprenorphine is available in several formulations, each designed to meet
various treatment needs and client preferences:

**1. Sublingual Tablets and Films:** The most common forms are
sublingual (under the tongue) tablets and films that dissolve
in the mouth. These forms allow for rapid absorption into the
bloodstream. Clients must avoid eating, drinking, or smoking
prior to and during the administration to ensure optimal
absorption.

**2. Buccal Films:** Like sublingual forms, buccal films are applied to
the inside of the cheek (buccal mucosa), where the medication is
absorbed.

**3. Long-Acting Injectable:** Buprenorphine is also available in a
long-acting injectable form, administered monthly by a healthcare professional. This option can improve
compliance by eliminating the need for daily dosing.

**4. Implantable Devices:** Buprenorphine can be administered through a small implant placed under the
skin, which releases the medication over a period of several months. This form is less common and
used for clients who require long-term, steady dosing and has demonstrated stability on transmucosal
buprenorphine.

Buprenorphine is available outside of OTPs, through non-OTP healthcare settings (e.g., physicians’ offices,
outpatient drug treatment programs). Section 1262 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 removes the
federal requirement for practitioners to have an “X” waiver to prescribe buprenorphine. All practitioners who
have a current DEA registration that includes Schedule III authority, may now prescribe buprenorphine for OUD
in their practice if permitted by applicable state law.

Buprenorphine is marketed under several brand names (as indicated in the text box), each tailored for different
uses, including the treatment of pain and opioid use disorder.¹⁰⁰
