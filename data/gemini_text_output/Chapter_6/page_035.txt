CHAPTER 6: Evidence-based Practices

**Use of MAT During Pregnancy**¹⁰¹, ¹⁰²

Substance use while pregnant, especially opioid use, has escalated dramatically in recent years, mirroring the
epidemic observed in the general public. Pregnancy provides an important opportunity to identify and treat
women with SUDs. Pregnant women who undergo early universal screening and referral to treatment and
supportive services show improved maternal and infant outcomes. The types of agencies and professionals
providing treatment and other services to pregnant women with OUDs can vary widely from one community to
another. Every professional involved needs to understand a pregnant woman’s distinct needs, and those of her
family members, before implementing the most appropriate and comprehensive plan of care.

Pregnant women who are physically dependent on opioids should
receive MAT from a physician rather than withdrawal management
or abstinence, since those approaches may pose a risk to the pregnant
woman and the fetus. According to the American College of Obstetricians
and Gynecologists (ACOG), the current standard of care for pregnant
women with OUDs is referral for MAT with methadone and/or
buprenorphine since “abrupt discontinuation of opioids in an opioid-
dependent pregnant woman can result in preterm labor, fetal distress, or
fetal demise.”¹⁰³

Since the 1970s, opioid agonist pharmacotherapy with methadone in
combination with counseling and behavioral therapy has been the
standard treatment of heroin addiction during pregnancy.¹⁰⁴ In later
years, methadone and buprenorphine are first-line therapy options for
pregnant people with OUD, recommended by both the ACOG and SAMHSA,
in conjunction with behavioral therapy and medical services. While
some treatment centers use naltrexone to treat OUD in pregnant women,
current information on its safety during pregnancy is limited. ACOG
recommends that if a woman is stable on naltrexone prior to pregnancy,
the decision regarding whether to continue naltrexone treatment during
pregnancy should involve a careful discussion between the provider
and the client, weighing the limited safety data on naltrexone with the
potential risk of relapse with discontinuation of treatment.¹⁰⁵

It is important to recognize that **Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome (NOWS)** is an expected condition that
can follow exposure to MAT for an OUD. A concern for NOWS alone should not deter healthcare providers from
prescribing medication. Close collaboration with the pediatric care team can help ensure that infants born to
people who used opioids during pregnancy are monitored for NOWS and receive appropriate treatment, as well as
be referred to needed services.¹⁰⁶

For pregnant women diagnosed with an OUD, there is a chance that their infant may experience withdrawal
symptoms after birth. Like any medication given during pregnancy, MAT has both risks and benefits to the
mother and fetus. Therefore, MAT needs careful consideration and coordination from all treatment and medical
professionals involved.

» NOWS represents the pattern of effects linked to withdrawal for newborns with prenatal exposure to
certain substances, including opioids. Many factors influence NOWS symptoms, including the type of
opioid involved, the point in gestation when the mother used the opioid, genetic factors, and exposure to
multiple substances including tobacco.¹⁰⁷

» NOWS is a treatable condition. According to ACOG, “All infants born to women who use opioids during
pregnancy should be monitored for neonatal abstinence syndrome and treated if indicated. There are no
known risks of increased birth defects with pharmacotherapy medications.”¹⁰⁸

SAMHSA, along with the National
Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA),
the American Society of Addiction
Medicine (ASAM), the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC), and the American Medical
Association (AMA) all recommend
MAT as a best practice. The
American College of Obstetricians
and Gynecologists (ACOG) also
recommends MAT as best practice
for treating pregnant women with
OUDs.
