**3. Contingency Management:** Using reinforcement strategies to encourage abstinence and other positive
behaviors, often through tangible rewards.

**4. Home-Based Reinforcement Strategies:** Implementing changes in the home environment to support
recovery, such as removing substances or substance-related cues and creating a structured routine.

Research on FBT has demonstrated its effectiveness in reducing substance use and improving family functioning.
Studies have shown significant reductions in drug and alcohol use, improvements in mental health symptoms,
and enhanced family relationships. FBT is particularly effective when family members are actively engaged in
the treatment process and when the therapy is tailored to the specific needs and cultural background of the
family.⁶³

**Behavioral Couples Therapy (BCT)**

**Behavioral Couples Therapy (BCT)** addresses the intertwined challenges of SUDs and relationship distress.⁶⁴
BCT facilitates both recovery from substance use and the enhancement of relationship satisfaction by focusing
on the couple as a unit and leveraging the supportive potential of intimate relationships. It is grounded in social
learning theory, which suggests that behavior is learned and maintained through interactions with the social
environment, including significant others. It underscores the role of mutual reinforcement processes, where the
behaviors of each partner affect the other, creating patterns that can either worsen or alleviate substance use.

The intervention strategy of BCT includes several important components:⁶⁵

» **Sobriety Contracts:** Couples establish agreements where the individual with SUD commits to abstinence,
and both partners agree on rewards for maintaining sobriety.

» **Communication Skills Training:** Couples are taught effective communication strategies to improve their
ability to express needs, listen actively, and resolve conflicts without resorting to substance use.

» **Problem-Solving Training:** This component focuses on developing the couple’s ability to collaboratively
address problems, including those related to substance use, in a constructive manner.

» **Relapse Prevention Planning:** Couples work together to identify triggers for substance use, develop
strategies to avoid or cope with these triggers, and plan for how to manage potential relapses.

A large and growing body of evidence supports the effectiveness of Behavioral Couples Therapy. Dozens of
randomized clinical trials have found evidence for Behavioral Couples Therapy being more effective than both
the placebo or no treatment at all.⁶⁶ Research also has shown Behavioral Couples Therapy to increase abstinence
rates and improve relationship functioning better than classic individual-based treatment, while also reducing
social costs, domestic violence, and emotional problems in children of the couple.⁶⁷

**Family Therapies for Treating SUDs in Adolescents**

The prevailing and extensively researched evidence-based programs that focus on families that have adolescents
in treatment are:

» **Multi-Systemic Therapy (MST).** MST is an evidence-based treatment originally developed for youth
with serious antisocial behavior who are at high risk for out-of-home placement and their families;
and subsequently adapted to address other challenging clinical problems experience by youths and their
families. The therapy focuses on the multiple aspects of a young person’s social network, including
their family, peers, school, and neighborhood, to address the complex needs that contribute to antisocial
behaviors. MST is one of the most extensively evaluated family-based treatments. Outcome research
has yielded almost uniformly favorable results for youth and families, and implementation research has
demonstrated the importance of treatment and program fidelity in achieving such outcomes.⁶⁸
