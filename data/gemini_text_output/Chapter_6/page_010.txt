**THE PLANNING PHASE**

The Planning phase occurs after the processes of engaging, focusing, and evoking. This phase is dedicated to developing a concrete plan of action that guides the client toward their desired change. It involves collaboratively setting goals and strategies for change, based on the motivation and commitment the client has developed through the MI process. The Planning phase is essential for translating the client's desire, ability, reasons, and need for change into actionable steps through:

1.  **Collaborative Goal Setting:** The counselor and client work together to set achievable, specific, and meaningful goals. These goals are directly informed by the client's values and motivations for change that have been elicited in earlier conversations.
2.  **Developing a Plan of Action:** The next step is to outline a detailed plan for achieving them. This plan may include identifying specific actions, steps, or behaviors that the client will undertake. It also involves considering any potential barriers to change and strategies for overcoming them.
3.  **Strengthening Commitment:** This phase is also an opportunity to strengthen the client's commitment to their goals. This can involve discussing the importance of the change, the client's confidence in their ability to achieve it, and affirming their commitment to taking action.
4.  **Flexible and Client-Centered:** Plans developed during this phase are flexible and can be revised as needed. It's important that the plan is client-centered and considers the client's preferences, lifestyle, and unique circumstances. Counselors can help clients move forward with confidence and increase the likelihood of sustained change.

**EXAMPLE OF PLANNING DIALOGUE**

**Counselor:** "Based on what we've discussed, it seems like reducing your alcohol intake is a priority for you. What are some specific steps you feel ready to take towards this goal?"

**Client:** "I think I could start by not drinking on weekdays."

**Counselor:** "That sounds like a clear and manageable step. How confident do you feel about implementing this change starting next week?"

**Client:** "Pretty confident, I guess. I could use some strategies for what to do when I get the urge to drink, though."

**Counselor:** "Let's explore some strategies together. We can also consider who in your life might support you in this change."

**Other Evidence-Based Practices Using a Motivational Approach**

**CONTINGENCY MANAGEMENT**

**Contingency Management (CM)**²⁰ is one of the most effective behavioral interventions for problematic substance use. CM provides incentives to change behavior. Unlike MI techniques, which are based on an individual's intrinsic motivation (i.e., motivation that arises from within), CM strategies are based on extrinsic motivation (i.e., motivation derived from sources outside the individual). By incentivizing goal attainment and treatment adherence with tangible rewards, CM addresses the immediate reinforcement that substance use provides. This method's success is significantly increased when paired with motivational strategies that help clients internalize the desire for change. By understanding the personal values and goals of the client, counselors can tailor CM rewards in a way that better aligns with the individual's motivations, leading to sustained behavior change.²¹
