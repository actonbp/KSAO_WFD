**CBT STRUCTURED THERAPEUTIC ACTIVITIES**

CBT is not only interactive and collaborative but also highly structured. A key aspect of its structure involves the use of workbooks, homework assignments, and other practical tools designed to facilitate the cognitive restructuring process and reinforce the skills learned during therapeutic sessions. This structure is instrumental in helping individuals apply CBT principles to their daily lives, enhancing the therapy’s effectiveness and promoting long-term improvement.

**Workbooks** are the foundation of CBT’s structured approach. They typically contain educational material, exercises, and worksheets that guide individuals through the process of identifying, evaluating, and challenging their negative thoughts and beliefs. These workbooks serve as a resource for clients to learn more about the CBT model, understand their patterns of thinking and behavior, and systematically work through exercises designed to foster change. They are particularly useful for individuals to reference outside of counseling sessions, allowing continuous engagement with the therapeutic process.

**Homework** is another integral component of CBT’s structure, emphasizing the application of skills learned in counseling to real-life situations. Homework assignments may include:³²

» **Practice exercises:** Activities designed to reinforce cognitive restructuring techniques, such as recording and analyzing automatic thoughts or practicing alternative responses to challenging situations.

» **Behavioral experiments:** Tasks that encourage individuals to test the validity of their beliefs in real-world settings, helping to gather evidence against cognitive distortions.

» **Exposure tasks:** Specifically for individuals with anxiety disorders, assignments might involve gradual, controlled exposure to feared objects or situations to reduce avoidance behaviors and fear responses.

» **Skill-building activities:** Assignments aimed at enhancing specific skills, like assertiveness, communication, or problem-solving, relevant to the individual’s therapeutic goals.

CBT sessions often begin with a review of the homework from the previous session. Progress tracking, using thought records, mood logs, or behavior charts, is a critical part of this process. It provides tangible evidence of change over time and helps to identify areas that may require further attention. This structured approach facilitates the internalization of cognitive-behavioral techniques and equips them with the tools necessary for managing challenges and maintaining mental health gains long after the therapy has concluded.³³

**Other Practices that Use Cognitive Behavioral Therapy as a Foundation**

CBT’s value is not only in its direct application but also in its influence on the development of other therapeutic approaches, such as Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), and others which incorporate its cognitive-behavioral principles. These therapies adapt and expand upon the foundational principles of CBT, tailoring them to specific conditions, populations, or treatment philosophies.

**DIALECTICAL BEHAVIOR THERAPY (DBT)**

Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) is an evidence-based treatment initially developed by Marsha Linehan for individuals with borderline personality disorder, particularly those with a history of suicidal behavior.³⁴ At its core, DBT is a form of CBT. It extends CBT by including acceptance-based strategies, such as validation, mindfulness (derived from Zen Buddhism), and
