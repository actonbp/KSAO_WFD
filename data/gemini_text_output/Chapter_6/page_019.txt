CHAPTER 6: Evidence-based Practices 281

**Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)⁵⁰**

**Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)** is an evidence-based practice that has been shown to help people with a variety of behavioral health and physical health conditions. ACT rests on the fundamental premise that pain, grief, disappointment, illness, and anxiety are inevitable parts of life. The main goal of ACT is to teach people how to handle these challenges in a healthy way by being more mentally flexible. Instead of trying to push away or ignore these tough feelings and thoughts, ACT encourages embracing them as part of life and moving forward with what’s important to the person, even when it’s hard. This approach can be used for different kinds of issues and is all about focusing on what a person can do about them, rather than what’s going wrong.⁵¹

ACT helps individuals accept what is out of their personal control and commit to action that improves and enriches their life. It utilizes mindfulness strategies alongside behavior change strategies to increase psychological flexibility. Psychological flexibility is the ability to recognize and understand our thoughts and emotions in any given situation, and then continue or change our behavior depending on what we value (or see as a positive outcome in the situation). Psychological flexibility is not escaping or avoiding difficult or painful experiences, but rather being able to be aware of them and work through them so that they no longer control or determine behavior. When used to address problematic substance use, ACT can help people in recovery learn to live with the discomfort of cravings, rather than attempting to eliminate or avoid it. ACT also can help people in recovery learn to live with distressing feelings, memories, and other internal experiences that can trigger cravings.⁵²

To develop psychological flexibility, clients learn six interrelated core processes. Each process builds on the one before it, helping clients navigate triggering situations.

**1. Acceptance:** Learning to accept uncomfortable feelings, urges, and thoughts rather than avoiding or fighting them.

**2. Cognitive Defusion:** Techniques to reduce the impact and influence of negative thoughts and feelings.

**3. Being Present:** Encouraging mindfulness and attention to the present moment without judgment.

**4. Self as Context:** Helping individuals understand the self as a perspective rather than the content of one’s thoughts or the sum of experiences.

**5. Values:** Clarifying what is truly important and meaningful to the individual.

**6. Committed Action:** Taking effective action guided by one’s values despite potential obstacles or discomfort.

ACT has shown great success in the reduction of SUD symptoms by guiding individuals to accept urges and symptoms associated with problematic substance use and using psychological flexibility and value-based interventions to reduce those urges. It can be applied either as monotherapy or in combination with other therapies in the treatment of individuals with SUDs. ACT has proven beneficial in individual wellness and outcomes related to SUD treatment (including from a cost and administration perspective). Research has shown that ACT can result in:⁵³, ⁵⁴

» Relieved anxiety and guilt.
» The ability to experience negative thoughts and feelings without fixating on them or judging them.
» Increased psychological flexibility.
» Improvements in mental health and medical and behavioral health outcomes.
» Improved achievement of long-term goals.
