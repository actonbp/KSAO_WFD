CHAPTER 6: Evidence-based Practices 303

**Home**

Housing supports the long-term recovery of people recovering from SUDs. People may face barriers to obtaining
and maintaining stable housing due to discrimination, having a criminal background or poor credit history, and
systemic disenfranchisement. To support clients in this area, counselors should be aware of the barriers clients
may face and provide information and resources about how to maintain stable housing and help clients develop
life skills, including financial literacy (for example, how to keep a budget and minimize debt), and create long-
lasting relationships with family and friends. Counselors should also connect clients with a case manager or
social worker to assist with additional housing needs.

Several types of housing models and programs exist that may address the needs of those recovering from
problematic substance use. These models, described below, may focus on people recovering from substance use–
related problems or address other needs, such as homelessness or income barriers. Each program has a different
philosophical approach and eligibility requirements.

**SUPPORTIVE HOUSING**

**Permanent Supportive Housing¹¹⁹** is an evidence-based model used for individuals or families experiencing
homelessness who also have a disability or other co-occurring condition, which can include SUDs. This type of
housing offers a combination of housing and services designed for clients experiencing chronic homelessness.
Permanent supportive housing is guided by the principles of **Housing First**, a philosophy that emphasizes
immediate access to housing with supports and case management, but without the preconditions of abstinence
or mandatory participation in supportive services is an innovative and proven solution to some communities'
toughest problems. It combines affordable housing with services that help people who face the most complex
challenges to live with stability, autonomy, and dignity.

Supportive housing is funded through many federal agencies and developed by packaging together housing that
is affordable to persons with very low or extremely low incomes with flexible supportive services. These housing
programs across the country vary in terms of their structure, intensity of supportive services, length of time
of housing, eligibility requirements and the needs of the populations served. Programs offer varying degrees of
client support, yet nearly all include case management. Most supportive housing models accept families with
serious behavioral health disorders with the condition that there was no active substance abuse and that there
was a demonstrated interest in supportive services.

**Housing First** is a national approach to connect individuals and families experiencing homelessness quickly
and successfully to permanent housing. The Housing First approach views housing as the foundation for
life improvement and is guided by the belief that people need necessities like food and a place to live before
attending to anything less critical, such as getting a job, budgeting properly, or attending to substance use
issues. Additionally, Housing First is based on the theory that client choice is valuable in housing selection and
supportive service participation; exercising that choice is likely to make a client more successful in remaining
housed and improving their life. Housing First programs remove barriers faced by households trying to attain
permanent housing, and do not require prerequisites to access housing support beyond what is required in
a tenant’s lease. Since homelessness and substance use often overlap and the harms of substance use are
exacerbated by homelessness, housing in this context is considered an effective harm reduction strategy.¹²⁰

**Transitional Housing** offers interim stability and support to allow an individual to successfully move to and
maintain permanent housing. Unlike permanent supportive housing where residents dictate how long they want
to stay in the program, the length of stay for an individual in transitional housing is determined by the program.
Although the length of stay in transitional housing programs may vary, residents can stay in these programs for
up to 24 months. In transitional housing, residents receive supportive services, including around problematic
substance use. Transitional housing typically offers structure, supervision, life skills information, and in some
cases, education, and training. Program participants may be required to take part in supportive services that
are not disability-related services as a condition of participation in the program. For example, if the purpose of
the project is to assist participants with SUDs, projects may require participants to take part in SUD treatment
services.¹²¹
