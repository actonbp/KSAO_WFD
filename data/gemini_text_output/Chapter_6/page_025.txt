**Cognitive Processing Therapy**75

**Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT)** is a specific type of cognitive-behavioral therapy that has been extensively researched and is highly effective for treating post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and related conditions. It is designed to help individuals understand and change how they think about their trauma and its aftermath. The goal of CPT is to help clients learn how to challenge and modify unhelpful beliefs related to the trauma, reduce ongoing distress, and improve daily functioning. The key components are:

1.  **Structured Approach:** CPT is typically delivered over 12 to 16 sessions, each lasting about 60 minutes. The therapy can be administered in individual or group settings.
2.  **Focus on Stuck Points:** The therapy identifies “stuck points,” which are unhelpful or distorted thoughts that prevent individuals from recovering from their trauma. These stuck points often pertain to themes of safety, trust, power/control, esteem, and intimacy.
3.  **Writing and Talking About the Trauma:** Clients are often asked to write detailed accounts of their traumatic experiences, which are then used in the therapy sessions to identify and challenge stuck points.
4.  **Cognitive Restructuring:** Central to CPT is the practice of challenging and modifying unhelpful beliefs and thoughts.
5.  **Homework Assignments:** Between sessions, clients complete homework assignments to practice the skills learned in therapy, reinforcing the cognitive restructuring process.

Numerous studies have shown that CPT significantly reduces the symptoms of PTSD, depression, and anxiety. For example, a meta-analysis found that CPT was effective in reducing and maintaining PTSD symptoms across various populations, including military veterans and survivors of sexual assault.76, 77

**Prolonged Exposure Therapy (PE)**

**Prolonged Exposure Therapy (PE)** is also grounded in cognitive-behavioral principles and is designed to treat post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and related conditions. The core theory behind PE is that exposure to thoughts, feelings, and situations related to trauma in a controlled and therapeutic manner can help reduce the power these experiences have over an individual. The therapy is based on the idea that repeated exposure to trauma-related stimuli reduces the psychological distress associated with these stimuli over time, through a process called habituation. The key components are:

1.  **Psychoeducation:** Clients are educated about common reactions to trauma and the specific treatment approach of PE, establishing a rationale for the treatment.
2.  **Breathing Retraining:** Clients are taught breathing techniques to help manage immediate feelings of anxiety and stress.
