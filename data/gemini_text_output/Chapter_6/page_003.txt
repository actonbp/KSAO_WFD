with medication-assisted treatment (also termed pharmacotherapy or MAT).4 Regardless of the substance for
which the individual seeks treatment or the setting or level of care, all SUD treatment programs are expected to
offer an individualized set of evidence-based clinical components. Treatment programs that offer more of these
evidence-based components have the greatest likelihood of producing better outcomes.5

EBP Implementation Issues

The implementation of EBPs is a complex process, such that the term
implementation science has been coined to encompass the many issues
that can affect successful implementation. Implementation science
focuses on the study of methods to promote the systematic movement
of research findings and evidence-based practices (EBPs) into routine
practice. An exploration of this science is beyond the purpose of this
study guide, however, there are a few critical points to be highlighted.

Most EBPs require comprehensive training and supervision. It is essential
that SUD counselors get trained in the chosen evidence-based practices,
thereby maximizing their effectiveness in treating clients. Effective
counselor training goes beyond initial instruction to include ongoing
support mechanisms, such as supervision and consultation, to ensure
that EBPs are implemented correctly in practice settings.

Training helps ensure that interventions are delivered with **fidelity**.
Fidelity has been defined as the extent to which an intervention was
delivered as conceived and planned, to arrive at effectiveness in achieving
the target outcomes.6 High fidelity to EBPs is crucial because it ensures
that the interventions delivered in practice mirror those proven effective
in research. This adherence maximizes the likelihood that clients will
receive the full benefits of the interventions.7

There can be significant implementation failure if programs and/or practices are not delivered with fidelity.
Fidelity can be lost when service providers fail to apply the techniques of the evidence-based practice as they
were trained. Programs often lose their fidelity to new protocols over time or when they are implemented in
unique settings. It is best to measure fidelity through multiple approaches. Fidelity checklists can be used;
these checklists identify the critical components of an approach and delineate those that are essential and non-
essential to program integrity. A variety of other monitoring activities can also be applied such as supervisor
observation and use of videotaping or audio recording for supervision of the intervention sessions.8

Another implementation issue is "fit." Fit refers to how well a program matches, or is appropriate for, the
community, organization, stakeholders, and potential participants. It is important to address the concerns that
some EBPs are not culturally appropriate or otherwise a good "fit" for specific populations. Imposing EBPs
when they do not consider the perspectives of a specific population may result in clients' lack of interest or
engagement in the treatment program. While the best fit is desired, encouraging strict fidelity to the EBP during
implementation can limit both a practitioner's ability to be person-centered or culturally appropriate and the
opportunity for practitioners to learn from adaptations that may improve outcomes.9
