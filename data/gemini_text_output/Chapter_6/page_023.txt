CHAPTER 6: Evidence-based Practices 285

» **Multi-Dimensional Family Therapy (MDFT).** MDFT is a comprehensive and multisystemic family-based
outpatient or partial hospitalization program for adolescents with problematic substance use and those
at risk for continued substance abuse and other behavioral problems. It integrates individual, family, and
environmental interventions to optimize growth and development for the adolescent and family. The
therapy is structured around four primary domains: adolescent and parent(s) individually, the parent–
adolescent relationship, and interaction with family and social systems, demonstrating effectiveness
in reducing substance use and improving family functioning among adolescents with SUDs and related
disorders.⁶⁹

» **Brief Strategic Family Therapy (BSFT).** BSFT is designed to treat children and adolescents with behavior
problems, including conduct disorders, oppositional behavior, delinquency, and problematic substance
use. It aims to improve family interactions believed to be contributing to the child’s behavior problems,
focusing on improving family communication, problem-solving, conflict resolution, and effective
parenting skills. BSFT has been shown to be effective in reducing substance use and other problematic
behaviors in adolescents, improving family functioning, and increasing treatment engagement and
retention compared to traditional services.⁷⁰

» **Functional Family Therapy (FFT).** FFT is a short-term intervention program for young people with
behavioral problems, delinquency, and problematic substance use. The therapy focuses on enhancing
family communication, supportiveness, and problem-solving skills while decreasing negativity and
dysfunctional patterns of behavior. FFT is structured in phases that include engagement, motivation,
assessment, behavior change, and generalization, with each phase designed to build on the strengths
within the family and the individual to achieve improved behavior and relationships. FFT has been found
effective in reducing recidivism, improving family functioning, and decreasing problem behaviors in
adolescents.⁷¹

On the left, a man with glasses and a light-colored collared shirt looks towards the center. In the middle, a younger person with dark, curly hair, wearing a horizontally striped long-sleeve shirt and a necklace, looks towards the right with a thoughtful or serious expression. On the right, a woman with dark hair rests her chin on her hand, looking downwards with a pensive or distressed expression. They are seated, and the lighting suggests an indoor setting. The focus is on their expressions and interactions.]
