CHAPTER 6: Evidence-based Practices 269

» **Discord,** on the other hand, describes tension or a lack of harmony in the client–counselor relationship. It might arise from a mismatch in goals, a breakdown in communication, or perceived lack of empathy. Recognizing and addressing discord is crucial for maintaining a productive therapeutic alliance.

The shift underscores the importance of understanding and empathetically engaging with the client’s perspective. Here are some strategies that can be used to augment this principle:

One person, possibly a counselor, is seen from the back, sitting and facing the other individual. The second individual, likely the client, is seated on a couch, facing the first person and gesturing with their hands while speaking. The client is wearing a patterned shirt and appears engaged in conversation.]

» **Reflecting on Sustain Talk:** Instead of challenging sustain talk, counselors reflect it back to the client, helping them hear their own ambivalence and explore it further.

» **Exploring Values:** Counselors help clients explore their values and how the change aligns with these, often revealing discrepancies that motivate change.

» **Adjusting to Discord:** When discord arises, counselors strive to understand its source and adjust their approach, often by expressing empathy, validating the client’s feelings, and reaffirming their autonomy.

**OARS SKILLS**¹⁶

MI employs several core communication strategies known as the OARS skills. The acronym stands for Open-ended Questions, Affirmations, Reflective Listening, and Summarizing. Understanding and effectively using OARS can significantly enhance the engagement and motivation of clients in SUD counseling.

**Open-ended Questions** are designed to encourage clients to explore their thoughts and feelings without a simple ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer. They invite elaboration and provide the counselor with valuable insights into the client’s perspectives, motivations, and ambivalence.

**Example:**

**Counselor:** “What brought you here today?”

**Client:** “I guess I’ve been feeling like my drinking is starting to affect my job and family.”

**Counselor:** “It sounds like you’ve noticed some important areas being impacted. Can you tell me more about that?”

This open-ended question encourages the client to reflect on their substance use and its consequences, facilitating deeper exploration of their concerns.

**Affirmations** are statements that recognize clients’ strengths, efforts, and successes. They are used to build confidence and reinforce positive self-regard, supporting the client’s belief in their ability to change.

**Example:**

**Client:** “I managed to stay sober at the party last night, even though it was really tough.”

**Counselor:** “That’s a significant achievement, showing a lot of strength and commitment to your goals.”

This affirmation validates the client’s effort and resilience, boosting their confidence and motivation.
