CHAPTER 6: Evidence-based Practices 283

**EVIDENCE-BASED FAMILY APPROACHES**

Mainstream health care has long acknowledged the benefits of engaging family and social supports to improve treatment adherence and to promote behavioral changes needed to effectively treat many chronic illnesses.⁶⁰ This is also true for people with substance use disorders. Studies of various family therapies have demonstrated positive findings for both adults and adolescents.⁶¹ Here are several evidence-based family therapies that are widely used.

In the center, a young man with headphones around his neck, wearing a light-colored t-shirt, is seated and looking towards the woman on the left. On the right, a person with glasses and hair styled in a bun, wearing a light-colored top and a prominent bracelet, holds a glass and also looks towards the woman on the left. The individuals are seated, possibly on a couch or chairs, and the atmosphere suggests a serious discussion.]

**Family Behavior Therapy (FBT)⁶²**

Family Behavior Therapy (FBT) is a comprehensive intervention strategy that has shown promising results in treating SUDs. FBT not only addresses the substance use issues of the individual but also involves family members in the treatment process. FBT is rooted in behavioral theories. It integrates these principles with family systems theory, which proposes that families operate as interconnected systems, where changes in one part can influence the whole. FBT aims to modify maladaptive behaviors associated with substance use by involving family members in the treatment process, thereby creating a supportive and reinforcing home environment.

FBT strategies are comprised by several key components:

1.  **Behavioral Contracts:** Establishing agreements between the individual with SUD and family members to promote positive behaviors and reduce substance use.
2.  **Skill Training:** Teaching individuals and family members practical skills in communication, problem-solving, and coping strategies to manage stress and avoid relapse.
