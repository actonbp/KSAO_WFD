**RECOVERY RESIDENCES**

For people who are newly sober, recovery housing can provide time and support as they learn how to sustain long-term recovery. In 2012, the National Association of Recovery Residences (NARR) published A Primer on Recovery Residences: FAQs,¹²² a document developed in collaboration with leading researchers in the field of recovery housing to define standards of operation across four levels of recovery residences.

Recovery residences are increasingly viewed as a viable and cost-effective option. These homes are a good option because they provide safe and healthy environments that support residents in their recovery. These communities empower people by providing support as they transition towards living independent and productive lives in their respective communities. Recovery homes offer a unique alternative for harm reduction—a component of the Housing First model—for individuals whose main goal is to find a sober living environment.¹²³

**Purpose**

Developing a sense of purpose is critical for long-term recovery and allows clients to both avoid substance use-related behaviors and engage in experiences that are enjoyable and rewarding. Counselors can support clients in developing a sense of purpose by offering tools so they can rewrite their personal narrative, pursue educational and employment opportunities, engage in volunteerism, and identify meaningful leisure activities.

One evidence-based practice – **Supported Employment (SE)** – is an approach to vocational rehabilitation for youth and adults with serious behavioral health conditions that emphasizes helping them obtain competitive work in the community and providing the supports necessary to ensure their success in the workplace. Services are individualized and consistent with the unique strengths, abilities, interests, and informed choice of the individual to help them succeed. SE programs help persons in recovery find jobs that pay competitive wages in integrated settings (i.e., with other people who don’t necessarily have disabilities) in the community.¹²⁴

**Community**

There is consistent evidence showing that recovery pathways are initiated and enhanced by positive social networks and the underlying changes in social identity that is associated with the transition from stigmatized groups to positive and prosocial groups.¹²⁵ There is also a growing literature that focuses on community engagement as a vital ingredient of recovery journeys, with engagement in recreational activities, training and employment, volunteering, and mutual aid and other peer activities seen as important components of a Recovery-Oriented System of Care (ROSC).¹²⁶ This is know as **social inclusion** – which encompasses the opportunity for the recovering individual to participate in key functions or activities and in economic, social and cultural life of their community, exercising the rights of their citizenship and enjoying an adequate standard of living and wellbeing.¹²⁷
