**EVIDENCE-BASED TRAUMA APPROACHES**

As discussed in Chapter 2, SUDs and trauma are chronic, debilitating conditions that frequently co-occur. Individuals with a history of problematic substance use may also have a history of trauma, even though they may not be able to recall aspects of their trauma. These individuals have a more complicated course of treatment and less favorable treatment outcomes compared to individuals with either disorder alone. Failing to address trauma in people who have problematic substance use can lead to worse outcomes.72

SUD counselors should be able to recognize the effects of trauma on the lives of people in recovery and use trauma-sensitive or trauma-responsive services. Those who have survived trauma will vary in how they experience it. A client may have emotional reactions (e.g., anxiety, guilt, sadness, depression); physical reactions (e.g., sweating, nausea, fatigue, sleep disturbances); and cognitive reactions (e.g., difficulty concentrating, memory problems, self-blame); among many others. Becoming trauma aware and informed is a first step in this process.73

SUD counselors can best serve clients who have experienced trauma by providing integrated treatment that combines therapeutic models to target presenting symptoms and disorders. Treatment may include the use of effective pharmacotherapies (medications). Having a comprehensive approach acknowledges that the disorders interact with each other, requiring tailored interventions. Some trauma treatment models have integrated curricula; others that address trauma alone can be combined with counseling techniques with which the counselor is already familiar. For example, Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) plays a fundamental role in treating trauma. The same strategies that focus on identifying and challenging dysfunctional thoughts, beliefs, and attitudes are also applied to traumatic experiences.

Key components of CBT for trauma include:74

1.  **Psychoeducation**: Educating clients about trauma and its effects helps normalize their experiences and sets the stage for treatment.
2.  **Cognitive Processing**: Clients are guided to identify and evaluate their trauma-related thoughts and beliefs, particularly those that are distorted or unhelpful, such as feelings of guilt or blame.
3.  **Exposure Therapy**: A critical element in trauma-focused CBT, where clients are gradually and systematically exposed to thoughts, feelings, and situations related to their trauma in a controlled way, to diminish their emotional response and avoidance behaviors.
4.  **Stress Management**: Teaching coping skills, such as relaxation techniques, mindfulness, and problem-solving, helps clients manage the anxiety and stress associated with their traumatic memories.
5.  **Emotional Regulation**: Clients learn strategies to manage intense emotions related to trauma, improving their ability to cope with distressing situations.
6.  **Relapse Prevention**: Developing long-term strategies to maintain gains and handle potential stressors or trauma reminders in the future.

CBT for trauma is often time-limited and goal-oriented, with a strong emphasis on practicing skills outside of counseling sessions to enhance resilience and coping. Counselors should be adept at tailoring these interventions to the individualâ€™s specific traumatic experiences and needs, fostering a supportive therapeutic environment where clients feel safe to explore and process their trauma.

Here are several widely used evidence-based treatments for trauma. **Appendix G** contains a more complete list of prevailing evidence-based trauma treatments.
