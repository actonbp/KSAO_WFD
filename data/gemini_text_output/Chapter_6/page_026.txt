3.  **In Vivo Exposure:** This involves real-life confrontation with situations, places, and objects that the person has been avoiding because they are reminders of the trauma. The goal is to reduce fear and avoidance behavior.

4.  **Imaginal Exposure:** Clients are asked to repeatedly recount the traumatic event aloud during therapy sessions to reduce the emotional impact of memories and to facilitate processing of the trauma.

5.  **Processing:** After imaginal exposure, the therapist and client discuss the thoughts and feelings that arose during the recounting, with the aim of altering any maladaptive beliefs and enhancing understanding of the event.

**Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy**<sup>78</sup>

**Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT)** is a structured, evidence-based treatment designed to help children, adolescents, and their caregivers overcome the emotional and psychological effects of trauma. It is particularly effective for those who have experienced traumatic events, such as physical or sexual abuse, natural disasters, accidents, or the loss of a loved one. TF-CBT is grounded in CBT principles. The treatment typically lasts between 12 to 16 sessions, though the duration can vary based on the individual's needs. The therapy can be delivered in individual, group, or family settings and is suitable for children and adolescents aged 3 to 18 years.

The therapy process of TF-CBT is structured around several core components, often remembered by the acronym PRACTICE:

» **Psychoeducation:** Educating the child and caregivers about the impact of trauma on thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and teaching about the therapy process.

» **Relaxation:** Teaching the child and caregivers stress management and relaxation techniques to cope with trauma-related anxiety and stress.

» **Affective Expression and Regulation:** Helping the child identify and manage a range of emotions and teaching them how to express feelings in a healthy way.

» **Cognitive Coping:** Assisting the child in identifying and challenging distorted or unhelpful thoughts related to the trauma and developing a more realistic and positive way of thinking.

» **Trauma Narrative and Processing:** Guiding the child in creating a detailed narrative of their traumatic experience(s) and helping them process the thoughts and feelings associated with the trauma.

» **In Vivo Gradual Exposure:** Gradually exposing the child to trauma reminders in a controlled and safe manner to reduce fear and avoidance behaviors.

» **Conjoint Child-Parent Sessions:** Facilitating sessions where the child and caregivers come together to discuss the trauma narrative and improve communication.

» **Enhancing Safety and Future Development:** Teaching the child and caregivers strategies for safety planning and skills for handling future stressors or potential traumas.

TF-CBT is evidence-based and has been validated in numerous studies, showing significant improvements in trauma-related symptoms, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, and behavioral problems. It also aims to improve the parent-child relationship and support the family's overall healing and resilience.<sup>79</sup>
