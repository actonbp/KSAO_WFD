CHAPTER 6: Evidence-based Practices 277

**5. Integration of New Thoughts:** The individual is encouraged to integrate these new, more adaptive thoughts into their daily thinking patterns. This involves practicing and reinforcing these thoughts in various situations, leading to changes in emotional responses and behaviors.

**Cognitive Restructuring Example:**

In this scenario, the counselor helps the client through the process of cognitive restructuring to enhance his refusal skills in situations where cocaine use is involved.

**Counselor:** “You’ve mentioned feeling worried about being able to refuse cocaine if it’s offered to you again. Can you share what thoughts come to mind in those moments?”

**Client:** “I keep thinking that if I say no, my friends will think I’m boring or judge me. It feels like I’ll lose them if I don’t participate.”

**Counselor:** “That sounds like a challenging situation. The thought that your friends will think less of you for refusing cocaine seems to be quite distressing. Would you consider this an automatic thought?”

**Client:** “Yeah, it hits me every time I’m in that situation.”

**Counselor:** “Let’s take a moment to examine that thought. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that your friends will think you’re boring or judge you for saying no?”

**Client:** “I don’t know, really. I guess I’ve never actually said no before, so I’m not sure how they’d react.”

**Counselor:** “I see. It’s based more on the anticipation of a reaction. How about evidence against that thought? Have you had experiences where you’ve made a choice for your health or safety, and it was respected?”

**Client:** “Well, there have been times when I’ve chosen not to drink because I was driving, and my friends were okay with it. They didn’t think I was boring then.”

**Counselor:** “That’s a valuable observation. It shows that your friends can understand and respect your choices. How might we reframe your original thought into something that can help you?”

**Client:** “Maybe I could think, ‘If I refuse cocaine and explain my reasons, my true friends will understand and respect my decision, just like when I’ve chosen not to drink.’”

**Counselor:** “That’s a more positive thought. How does it feel to think in that way?”

**Client:** “Less stressful, actually. It makes me feel like I have more control over the situation.”

**Counselor:** “I’m glad to hear that. Remember, thinking this way can help you to act in ways that support your goals for recovery. Once you have practiced this kind of thinking and response, it can help build your confidence in refusing cocaine, regardless of the situation.”

This conversation illustrates the cognitive restructuring process tailored to improving the client’s refusal skills in the context of cocaine use. By identifying, challenging, and reframing the client’s automatic negative thought, the client begins to see a more balanced perspective.
