**ELICITING CHANGE TALK USING THE DARN CAT ACRONYM¹⁸**

Eliciting change talk is the key task of the evoking
process. Change talk is any client speech that leans
towards motivation for change, such as any discussion
of the desire, ability, reasons, need, and commitment
or taking steps to change. The DARN CAT acronym
represents types of change talk that counselors aim to
elicit:¹⁹

» **D**esire (wanting to change)
» **A**bility (being able to change)
» **R**easons (having reasons to change)
» **N**eed (feeling a necessity to change)
» **C**ommitment (committing to change)
» **A**ctivation (being ready to change)
» **T**aking steps (taking action towards change)

It is holding up a white rectangular sign with its paws (only the paws are visible holding the sign from below). The sign has the words "DARN" written above "CAT" in large, black, capital letters. The background is plain white. The image is placed to the right of the text describing the DARN CAT acronym.]

**Eliciting Change Talk:**

1.  **Ask Open-Ended Questions:** These encourage the
    client to express desire, ability, reasons, and need
    for change in their own words.

2.  **Use Affirmations:** Affirming strengths and past
    successes can bolster the client’s confidence in
    their ability to change, touching on ability and
    commitment.

3.  **Reflective Listening:** Reflect back change talk, amplifying the client’s own motivations and intentions.

4.  **Summarize:** Bring together the client’s expressions of change talk, reinforcing their commitment and
    steps they’re ready to take.

**Examples of Eliciting Change Talk:**

» **Desire:** “What makes you want to change your drinking habits?”
» **Ability:** “Can you tell me about a time when you successfully managed to resist the urge to drink?”
» **Reasons:** “How do you think your life might improve if you changed your relationship with alcohol?”
» **Need:** “How important is it for you to make this change now?”
» **Commitment:** “What steps are you willing to take to reduce your drinking?”
» **Activation:** “It sounds like you’re ready to start making some changes. What’s the first step you’d like to
take?”
» **Taking Steps:** “What have you already done towards making this change?”

It is important to note that, although one’s level of motivation is a great predictor of outcomes, change is a
complex process. To be successful, the person must believe change is important, have confidence they can be
successful at making the change, have the energy and be committed to work in the immediate future on the
target issue.
