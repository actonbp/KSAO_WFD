CHAPTER 6: Evidence-based Practices 273

CM is most often used with individuals in recovery from stimulants, such as cocaine, methamphetamine, and
prescription stimulants. CM also has evidence as an effective treatment for alcohol, cannabis, and tobacco use
disorders and as an effective adjunctive intervention to medications for opioid use disorder.22 CM can be used
to identify healthy alternatives to problematic substance use and grow recovery strengths. For example, CM
approaches aim to sustain client engagement in treatment and promote recovery by providing positive incentives
to clients who engage in and sustain behavioral changes, such as abstinence from alcohol or drugs; medication
adherence; attendance at continuing care groups, mutual-help groups, or 12-Step recovery meetings; or
maintenance of a job or stable housing arrangement.

The goal of CM is to increase desired behaviors by providing immediate reinforcers when a specific behavior
occurs and withholding reinforcers when that behavior does not occur. Reinforcers are provided in the form of
tangible incentives that are often administered in two forms:23

1.  **Voucher-based reinforcement:** This type of incentive uses vouchers that have monetary value. Individuals
    earn vouchers for meeting specific treatment goals, such as submitting drug-free urine samples or
    attending therapy sessions. These vouchers have a monetary value and can be exchanged for goods or
    services that support healthy living, such as gym memberships, educational materials, or grocery items.
    The value of the vouchers typically increases with consecutive achievements to encourage sustained
    behavior change.

2.  **Prize incentives:** Direct financial incentives involve providing
    cash or cash-equivalent rewards to individuals for meeting
    specific treatment milestones. Similar to vouchers, the
    magnitude and frequency of rewards are often contingent on
    continuous achievement. This type of CM traditionally uses a
    “fishbowl model,” where clients draw a piece of paper out of
    a large bowl. On some pieces of paper are reaffirming phrases,
    such as “well done.” On others, there will be small cash prizes,
    and on one piece of paper will be the “jumbo” prize. Clients can
    increase their number of chances to win each time they achieve
    a specific behavior. However, if a recovery task is not completed,
    the chance to win resets to one.

He has a dark beard and mustache, and is wearing a dark beanie hat. He is also wearing a light-colored, possibly denim, open jacket or shirt over a darker, buttoned-up shirt. His arms are bent and his hands are not fully visible but appear to be holding the lapels of his outer garment or are tucked into it. The background is plain and light-colored. The image is positioned on the right side of the page, next to the description of "Prize incentives."]

Tailoring the incentive program to individual preferences and needs
is crucial for maximizing engagement and effectiveness. This might
involve allowing individuals to choose their rewards within a certain
framework or adjusting the size and frequency of rewards to match
individual treatment milestones. Implementing CM requires careful consideration to avoid potential ethical
pitfalls, such as creating undue inducement or encouraging material dependence. Clear guidelines and limits on
the value and type of incentives can help mitigate these concerns.

While CM is powerful, it is most effective when integrated into a broader treatment plan that includes
psychological and medical support. This ensures that the root causes of addiction are addressed alongside the
behavioral aspects of substance use.

**Community Reinforcement Approach with Vouchers (CRA-V)**

The **Community Reinforcement Approach (CRA)**, originally developed for individuals with alcohol use disorders,
has been successfully employed to treat a variety of substance use disorders for more than 35 years. CRA helps
people rearrange their lifestyles so that healthy, drug-free living becomes rewarding and thereby competes with
substance use. Counselors encourage clients to become progressively involved in alternative non-substance-
related pleasant social activities, and to work on enhancing the enjoyment they receive within the “community”
of their family and job. There are three variations of CRA that are based on the same operant mechanism.
The first variant is Adolescent Community Reinforcement Approach (A-CRA), which targets adolescents with
