**MUTUAL SUPPORT APPROACH**

**12-Step Facilitation (TSF)**

**Twelve-Step Facilitation (TSF)** is a structured, evidence-based program designed to encourage individuals with SUDs to engage in a community-based recovery process, such as those offered by Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) or Narcotics Anonymous (NA). The program is grounded in the philosophy of the 12 steps, which are a set of guiding principles outlining a course of action for recovery from addiction, compulsion, or other behavioral problems.

The TSF manual originated from Project MATCH, one of the largest addiction clinical trials, evaluating Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET), and Twelve-Step Facilitation (TSF). The study aimed to determine if individuals with alcohol use disorders benefited more from specific treatments based on their characteristics. Results showed TSF was as effective as CBT and MET. The original TSF manual was developed to provide a structured approach for counselors to help clients engage with 12-step programs and integrate its principles into their lives.⁸²

**Key Components of TSF:⁸³**

» **Acceptance and Surrender:** TSF emphasizes the acceptance of addiction as a chronic, progressive disease that requires lifelong abstinence and surrender to a higher power or greater reality beyond oneself.

» **Active Participation:** Individuals are encouraged to actively participate in 12-step meetings, share personal experiences, and engage with the community, fostering a sense of belonging and mutual support.

» **Working the Steps:** The program guides individuals through the 12 steps, which include admitting powerlessness over problematic substance use, acknowledging the need for help, making amends for past harms, and helping others with similar problems.

» **Sponsorship:** Participants are encouraged to work with a sponsor, an experienced member of the 12-step program who provides guidance, support, and mentorship through the recovery process.

» **Spiritual Growth:** While not religious, TSF has a spiritual component, urging individuals to explore their spirituality and develop a personal relationship with a higher power of their understanding.

The objectives of TSF are to promote abstinence from substances through a structured, supportive community framework, to help individuals recognize and accept their problematic substance use, to integrate individuals into the 12-step recovery community, and to facilitate ongoing support and personal growth and healing. TSF has five core sessions that introduce and integrate individuals into the 12-step recovery process, focusing on key principles and actions that support the objectives.

TSF is adaptable to various settings, including outpatient and residential treatment programs, and can be integrated with other therapeutic approaches to provide comprehensive care for individuals with SUD. Its effectiveness has been supported by research, showing improvements in abstinence rates, engagement in recovery activities, and overall well-being.⁸⁴, ⁸⁵, ⁸⁶
