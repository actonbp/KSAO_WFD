270 IC&RC Alcohol and Drug Counselor (ADC) Certification Examination Study Guide

**Reflective Listening** involves the counselor echoing back what the client has said, either by paraphrasing
or directly reflecting their words. This technique demonstrates that the counselor is actively listening and
understanding, helping to clarify and deepen the client's own understanding of their experiences and feelings.

**Example:**

**Client:** *"I feel like everyone is against me."*

**Counselor:** *"It sounds like you're feeling isolated and unsupported right now."*

Reflective listening here shows empathy and helps the client feel heard and understood, potentially
opening up more dialogue about these feelings.

**Summarizing** involves the counselor bringing together the key points of what the client has shared during the
session. It helps to highlight progress, reinforce shared understanding, and set the stage for moving forward.

**Example:**

**Counselor:** *"So today we've talked about how your drinking is starting to impact areas of your life that are
important to you, like your job and family. You've also shared a recent success in staying sober at a social event,
which shows your strength and commitment. What are your thoughts on the next steps?"*

Summarizing in this manner encapsulates the session's discussion, emphasizing both the challenges and
achievements, and prompts the client to think about future actions.

**FOCUSING AND ELICITING CHANGE TALK¹⁷** *[The superscript 17 is followed by two small, indistinct marks, possibly an apostrophe and a comma or period, or just print artifacts.]*

Focusing and eliciting change talk are fundamental components of MI that work hand in hand. Focusing ensures
that the conversation has direction and purpose, while the elicitation of change talk, guided by the DARN CAT
acronym, helps to strengthen the client's motivation for making those changes. Together, these strategies create
a powerful framework for facilitating meaningful and client-centered change.

Focusing involves identifying and maintaining a specific direction in conversations about change. It is about
finding and maintaining a shared goal or focus that guides the conversation. Focusing helps to clarify the
change that the client is considering, ensuring that both the counselor and the client are aligned in their
objectives.

**Implementing Focusing:**

1.  **Set the Agenda:** Begin by collaboratively setting an agenda that outlines what will be discussed. This
    helps to give the session structure and ensures that the client's priorities are front and center.

2.  **Explore Options:** Discuss various areas for potential change, allowing the client to express their thoughts
    and feelings about each.

3.  **Narrow the Focus:** Once various options have been explored, work together to decide on a specific focus
    for change. This is often the area where the client feels most motivated to work on.

4.  **Maintain Direction:** Keep the conversation on track by gently steering it back to the focus of change when
    it deviates.

**Example of Focusing Dialogue:**

**Counselor:** *"Considering what we've talked about, what area feels most pressing for you to address?"*

**Client:** *"I think I need to work on my drinking first. It's causing the most problems."*

**Counselor:** *"Alright, let's focus on understanding your relationship with alcohol and explore steps towards change."*
