Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy

Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) is a structured therapeutic program designed to prevent the relapse of major depression; it integrates mindfulness practices and principles with cognitive therapy. The primary strategies of MBCT include mindfulness meditation exercises, cognitive-behavioral strategies, and group discussions, with a focus on developing non-judgmental awareness of the present moment.⁵⁵ The intervention is generally delivered in group sessions over eight weeks, including daily homework exercises.

MBCT has shown effectiveness in the following areas.

1.  **Prevention of Depressive Relapse**: MBCT has shown effectiveness in preventing relapse for clients with three or more previous depressive episodes, providing an additive benefit to usual care.⁵⁶
2.  **Reduction of Anxiety and Stress**: Systematic reviews have identified that MBCT can positively affect anxiety, residual depression, mood regulation, and attentional control in individuals with various conditions, including bipolar disorder.⁵⁷
3.  **Improvement in Psychological Well-being**: Studies suggest improvements in mindfulness, personal accomplishment, self-compassion, quality of sleep, and relaxation after participation in MBCT.⁵⁸
4.  **Efficacy in Various Populations**: MBCT is effective in improving many biopsychosocial conditions, including addiction, and is beneficial in healthcare settings, schools, and the workplace. It is considered relatively safe, with ethical aspects warranting consideration.⁵⁹
