CHAPTER 6: Evidence-based Practices 305

Becoming involved with social groups can offer a sense of meaning to people and motivate them to become responsible for other group members, giving a sense of wellbeing and purposefulness that stems from a feeling of **belonging**. The human need to belong and be part of the collective can be a motivator for extending the self beyond the individual perspective and contribute significantly to a meaningful existence.¹²⁸ SUD counselors can foster belonging and social inclusion by helping clients learn about and connect to various community and social supports, such as peer recovery support specialists, 12-Step and mutual-help groups, recovery community organizations, and digital aids, such as online support groups, which can expand a client’s network beyond the immediate community.

**Recovery community organizations** (RCOs) and **recovery community centers** (RCCs) are invaluable resources for information, training, and partnership for SUD treatment programs.¹²⁹ **RCOs** are local, typically nonprofit organizations that support people with problematic substance use in achieving long-term recovery through a range of activities that can include peer support services, advocacy in the community, and public education about recovery. Not all RCOs have a physical location. RCOs are led and staffed mainly by people in recovery.

An RCC, a type of RCO, is a physical place where people in recovery, and people who want to be in recovery, can meet, get peer support services and other support, and participate in social activities like computer workshops and game nights. RCCs are central sites for recovery support groups, recovery-focused social networking, skill-building, advocacy, and volunteer activities. These settings offer a safe place for people to pursue their recovery goals and access resources.

**Peer-based recovery support services**, as shown in Chapter 2, are delivered by people with the lived experience of recovery from substance use or a mental health condition, either as a person in long-term recovery or a family member or significant other. Peer support offers a level of acceptance, understanding, and validation not found in many other professional relationships. By sharing their own lived experience and practical guidance, peer support workers help people to develop their own goals, create strategies for self-empowerment, and take concrete steps towards building fulfilling, self-determined lives for themselves.

Peer-based recovery support is the process of giving and receiving nonprofessional, non-clinical assistance to achieve long-term recovery. Peer supporters walk alongside people in recovery, offering individualized supports and demonstrating that recovery is possible. They share tools that can complement or replace clinical supports by providing strategies for self-empowerment and achieving a self-determined life.¹³⁰ Oftentimes, peer-based recovery support is provided by a person certified as a Recovery Peer Specialist – which brings the lived experience of recovery, combined with training and supervision, to assist others in initiating and maintaining recovery.

An SUD counselor’s tasks are to understand the different types and cultures of these communities of recovery as well as how they align with individuals’ chosen recovery pathways and cultural backgrounds.
