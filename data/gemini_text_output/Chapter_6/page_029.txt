CHAPTER 6: Evidence-based Practices 291

**MEDICATION-ASSISTED TREATMENTS**

Since the 1990s, dramatic increases in controlled medication prescriptions—particularly opioid pain relievers—
have coincided with increases in their misuse. Since the mid-2000s, heroin and fentanyl (mainly illicit
formulations) consumption has also sharply increased. Over the past five years, there has been a concerning rise
in opioid use, largely attributed to factors such as increased prescription of painkillers, the increased availability
of synthetic opioids like fentanyl, and economic and social stressors. This surge has been marked by a higher
prevalence of problematic use of prescription opioids and a significant uptick in the use of illicit opioids, leading
to a devastating impact on public health, including a spike in overdose deaths. The accessibility and potency of
these substances have prompted actions for enhanced prevention, treatment, and policy measures to address the
opioid crisis effectively.⁸⁷

In response to this crisis, there has been a notable rise in the use of Medication-Assisted Treatments (MAT),
which combine FDA-approved medications with counseling and behavioral therapies to effectively treat
substance use disorders. This approach helps moderate the problematic use of opioids and alcohol by providing
more comprehensive and sustainable treatment options, aiming to reduce withdrawal symptoms and cravings,
and prevent the escalation to more dangerous substances like heroin and fentanyl.

In addition to the opioid crisis, the prevalence of alcohol use disorders (AUD) remains a significant public health
challenge, with a notable impact on individuals, families, and society at large. Almost one-third of the U.S.
population meets AUD criteria on a lifetime basis.⁸⁸ According to the 2022 National Survey on Drug Use and
Health (NSDUH), 29.5 million people ages 12 and older (10.5% in this age group) had AUD in the past year.⁸⁹ Of
these, 753,000 are youth ages 12 to 17. The same study showed that only 2.2 million people ages 12 and older with
AUD received treatment, representing 7.6% of those with past-year AUD in this age group. Furthermore, many
more individuals engage in risky drinking or experience alcohol-related negative consequences who fall short of
meeting clinical diagnostic criteria for AUD. These alarming statistics highlight the importance of MAT services
for problematic alcohol use.

MAT is an evidence-based treatment for alcohol use disorders and opioid use disorders. MAT uses medications,
in combination with counseling and other therapeutic techniques, to provide a “whole-person” approach to the
treatment of SUDs. Its effectiveness is well-documented in numerous studies and publications, underscoring
its role in improving client outcomes and supporting long-term recovery.⁹⁰ The Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) has approved several different medications to treat alcohol use disorders (AUD) and opioid use disorders
(OUD). These medications relieve the withdrawal symptoms and psychological cravings that cause chemical
imbalances in the body. Medications used are evidence-based treatment options and do not just substitute one
drug for another.

According to SAMHSA, while MAT’s goal is full recovery, it has been shown to improve client survival, increase
retention in treatment, decrease illicit opiate use and other criminal activity among people with SUDs, increase
clients’ ability to gain and maintain employment, and improve birth outcomes among women who have SUDs
and are pregnant. The length of treatment is different for everyone, but research shows that the longer clients
are on MAT, the better their rates of long-term success. Some clients may be on MAT for the rest of their lives.
There is no right or wrong length of time – it all depends on the client’s needs. Research shows that clients
should receive medication for as long as it provides a benefit.⁹¹
