CHAPTER 6: Evidence-based Practices 293

**Medications for Opioid Use Disorder**⁹⁶

Three medications have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of opioid use disorders (OUD): methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone. These medications are effective for treating people with OUDs, as well as legally prescribed opioid pain relievers that are misused, such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, and morphine. The medications work by easing withdrawal symptoms from opioids and blocking their euphoric effects.

Each drug affects the brain in different ways. Knowing the pharmacological action of these medications helps counselors understand how these drugs will affect the client’s brain chemistry and behavior.

» **An agonist** is a drug that activates certain receptors in the brain. Full agonist opioids activate the opioid receptors in the brain fully resulting in the full opioid effect. Examples of full agonists are heroin, oxycodone, methadone, hydrocodone, morphine, opium, and others.

» **A partial agonist** drug activates the opioid receptors in the brain, but to a much lesser degree than a full agonist. Buprenorphine is an example of a partial agonist.

» **An antagonist** is a drug that blocks opioids by attaching to the opioid receptors without activating them. Antagonists cause no opioid effect and block full agonist opioids. Examples are naltrexone and naloxone.

MAT services for OUD are provided by **opioid treatment providers** (OTPs) of MAT are certified by the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and accredited by an independent, SAMHSA-approved accrediting body. Additionally, OTPs must be state-licensed and registered with the federal Drug Enforcement Administration.⁹⁷ Under federal regulations for methadone treatment, the medication must typically be administered daily in a certified opioid treatment program (OTP) unless a patient meets program-specific criteria for take-home doses. In accordance with federal law, buprenorphine may be prescribed by office-based clinicians, but they must first complete additional training and apply for a waiver. Naltrexone can also be prescribed by office-based clinicians, though without the need for additional approvals.

Currently, no empirical data indicates which clients will respond better to which OUD medications. All clients considering treatment should be educated about the effectiveness, risks, and benefits of each of the three OUD medications, treatment without medication, and no treatment. OUD medications are safe and effective when used appropriately, and clients reduce or stop illicit opioid use and improve their health and functioning.⁹⁸
