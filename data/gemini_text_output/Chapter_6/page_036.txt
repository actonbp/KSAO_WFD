Medications for alcohol use disorder (AUD) should be approached with caution in pregnant women due to potential risks to the fetus. The decision to use these medications must be carefully weighed against the risks of continued alcohol use. Here's a summary of considerations for some commonly used AUD medications:

» **Naltrexone:** Not typically recommended during pregnancy due to limited data on its safety. Animal studies have shown adverse effects, but there is insufficient human data.
» **Acamprosate:** Also has limited data on its use during pregnancy, and it's not well studied. It should only be used if the potential benefits justify the potential risks to the fetus.

Any medication use during pregnancy should be a decision made in collaboration with a healthcare provider, considering the specific circumstances and potential risks and benefits. It is crucial for pregnant women with AUD to seek medical advice and receive close monitoring throughout their pregnancy.
