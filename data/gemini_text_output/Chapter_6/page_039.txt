CHAPTER 6: Evidence-based Practices301

The following are signs and symptoms of an opioid overdose:

» Unconsciousness or inability to awaken.
» Slow or shallow breathing or difficulty breathing such as choking sounds or a gurgling/snoring noise from a person who cannot be awakened.
» Fingernails or lips turning blue/purple. For lighter skinned people, the skin tone may turn bluish purple; for darker skinned people, skin tone may turn pale/grayish or ashen.
» Pinpointed pupils or pupils that don’t react to light.

People with physical dependence on opioids may have withdrawal
symptoms within minutes after they are given naloxone. Withdrawal
symptoms might include headaches, changes in blood pressure, rapid
heart rate, sweating, nausea, vomiting, and tremors. While this is
uncomfortable, it is usually not life threatening. The risk of death for
someone overdosing on opioids is worse than the risk of having a bad
reaction to naloxone. If the person does not respond to the intervention
or the person who is trying to help doesn’t know what to do, placing an
immediate call to 911 is critical.

Naloxone works if a person has opioids in their system and has no
harmful effect if opioids are absent. Naloxone should be given to any
person who shows signs of an opioid overdose or when an overdose is
suspected. Overdoses involving highly potent synthetic opioids (e.g.,
fentanyl) or large quantities of opioids may require multiple doses of
naloxone. If respiratory function does not improve, naloxone doses may
be repeated every two to three minutes. **For more detailed information
about how to administer naloxone, the SAMHSA Overdose Prevention
and Response Toolkit is an excellent resource.**

People who witness an overdose are often afraid to intervene or to call for help because emergency medical
services (EMS) responders are often accompanied by law enforcement officers, and many aspects of the use
of controlled substances in the US remain illegal. To encourage bystanders to intervene, most states have
enacted overdose “Good Samaritan” legislation that provides limited immunity from criminal penalty charges
to individuals who intervene, as well as, in most cases, the person who overdosed. As of March 2024, 48
jurisdictions (47 states and the District of Columbia) have enacted both “Good Samaritan” and Naloxone Access
laws. Kansas, Texas, and Wyoming do not have a Good Samaritan law for drug overdoses but have a Naloxone
Access law.113 Naloxone Access laws provide for the availability of naloxone, allowing pharmacists to distribute
naloxone without a personal prescription, protect individuals who administer naloxone in good faith from legal
liability, and sometimes include provisions for training and education on the use of naloxone to prevent overdose
deaths.

SUD counselors, particularly those who work with people with OUD, need to understand the use, benefits,
and risks of naloxone to effectively support individuals at risk of opioid overdose. By being knowledgeable
about naloxone, counselors can educate clients on its life-saving potential, guide its proper use during
emergencies, and manage expectations regarding its limitations and the possibility of withdrawal symptoms
post-administration. This understanding is crucial for developing comprehensive treatment plans that
include overdose prevention strategies, thereby improving patient safety and outcomes in opioid dependence
management.
