CHAPTER 6: Evidence-based Practices 275

**BEHAVIORAL TREATMENTS –**
**COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL APPROACHES**

Cognitive-behavioral approaches are the most common, evidence-based treatments for individuals who have problematic substance use.²⁶ The cognitive-behavioral model assumes that individuals are continually interpreting and responding to information perceived from their internal and external environments. Individuals develop representations of their environments in the form of thoughts, attitudes, and beliefs. These representations can affect how individuals feel and behave. When representations of the environment are inaccurate or unhelpful, they can be examined, challenged, and modified. As clients learn to reevaluate situations and develop helpful thinking patterns, they may notice that they feel better and make healthier behavior choices.

Cognitive-behavioral approaches are based on social learning theory, such that substance use occurs in the context of learned behavior (i.e., modeling, classical and operant conditioning).²⁷ As patterns of problematic substance use emerge, individuals have more difficulties coping with distressing thoughts and emotions. Multiple variations of SUD treatment interventions use components of the cognitive-behavioral framework, including the relapse prevention model, guided self-change, and the community reinforcement approach.²⁸

In recovery, the cognitive-behavioral model focuses on helping clients replace thinking patterns and risk behaviors that undermine recovery efforts with thinking and behavioral patterns that support and sustain recovery. Cognitive changes that support recovery from problematic substance use vary according to the substance used, but generally emphasize challenging or deconstructing positive beliefs about substance use or engaging in other risk behaviors and negative beliefs about identity that decrease self-efficacy.

**Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)²⁹**

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a widely used, evidence-based approach. CBT is supported by a vast amount of research evidence showing its effectiveness in treating a wide range of disorders, including depression, anxiety, PTSD, and substance use disorders. CBT has also been found to be adaptable to different cultures, age groups, and used through various delivery methods (individual sessions, group therapy, online platforms). It is a problem-oriented strategy that focuses on current problems and finding solutions for them. While understanding the historical roots of psychological problems is considered, CBT primarily focuses on current challenges and practical solutions.

The core premises of CBT revolve around the interconnectedness of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and the impact of cognitive (thought) processes on emotional well-being and action. The following foundational principles guide the therapeutic process, aiming to provide individuals with the tools to modify their thinking patterns to achieve more positive outcomes.³⁰

1.  **Interconnectedness of Thoughts, Feelings, and Behaviors:** At the heart of CBT is the belief that our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are deeply interconnected. This means that negative thoughts can lead to negative emotions and behaviors, and vice versa. By identifying and addressing maladaptive thought patterns, CBT can alter emotional states and behaviors in a positive way.

2.  **Cognitive Distortions:** CBT suggests that psychological distress is often due to cognitive distortions which are inaccurate or exaggerated thought patterns. Examples include “overgeneralization,” “catastrophizing,” and “personalization.” These thoughts can lead to a distorted view of oneself, others, and the world, contributing to emotional distress and maladaptive behaviors. For people with SUDs, cognitive distortions bring them closer to situations where temptation is strong and difficult to resist. CBT helps them lessen the power of cognitive distortions by teaching them how to slow down their thinking process and identify steps leading up to a decision.
