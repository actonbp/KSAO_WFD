**Medications for Alcohol Use Disorder⁹²**

A SAMHSA/National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) national consensus panel recommends pharmacotherapy along with behavioral interventions for AUD. Yet, in 2022, only 2.1% of clients with AUD were treated with medications in the past year.⁹³ This is of serious concern because of the high prevalence of alcohol use and related issues in the general population. It is important to emphasize, however, that the involvement of physicians and other health/behavioral health care professionals in identifying and treating AUD is possible, practical, and necessary. The medications described in this section have been shown to be effective for the management of AUDs or the prevention of a recurrence to alcohol use.

Acamprosate, disulfiram, and naltrexone are the most common drugs used to treat AUD.

» **Acamprosate** (Campral) was approved by the FDA in 2004 with demonstrated primary effectiveness for maintaining abstinence from alcohol. The target population for this medication would include people who want continued sobriety after a period of abstinence and who do not have severe kidney problems. It works to prevent people from drinking alcohol, but it does not prevent withdrawal symptoms after people drink alcohol. The use of acamprosate typically begins on the fifth day of abstinence, reaching full effectiveness in five to eight days. It is taken in tablet form three times a day.

Acamprosate is well tolerated, with generally mild side effects. Its use is not affected by liver function, making it suitable for people with liver disease, a common comorbidity in alcohol-dependent individuals. The most frequently reported side effects of Acamprosate include gastrointestinal disturbances such as diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. Some people may also experience itching, rash, dizziness, and fatigue.

» **Disulfiram** (Antabuse) was approved by the FDA approved in 1949 and has modest effectiveness in preventing recurrence in problematic alcohol use, particularly when medication adherence is supervised. This medication treats chronic AUDs and is most effective in people who have already stopped drinking alcohol or are in the initial stage of abstinence. Taken in a tablet form once a day, disulfiram should never be taken while intoxicated and it should not be taken for at least 12 hours after drinking alcohol.

Disulfiram does not reduce the craving for alcohol, but it causes unpleasant symptoms when alcohol is ingested because it inhibits aldehyde dehydrogenase and alcohol metabolism. These side effects (nausea, headache, vomiting, chest pains, difficulty breathing) can occur as soon as ten minutes after drinking even a small amount of alcohol. The side effects provide negative reinforcement which in turn promotes alcohol avoidance in AUD.

» **Naltrexone** (ReVia and Vivitrol) is used in the treatment of both alcohol and opioid use disorders due to its ability to block the euphoric effects of these substances. The FDA approved oral naltrexone for the treatment of alcohol dependence or alcoholism in 1994. The low rate of retention and adherence encountered with oral naltrexone led to the development of the extended-release injectable formulation, which the FDA approved for the treatment of alcohol use disorder in 2006.⁹⁴ Brand names are:

  › **ReVia**: One of the earliest brand names for naltrexone, primarily used for treating alcohol dependence.
  › **Vivitrol**: A long-acting, injectable form of naltrexone

Naltrexone lessens the rewarding effects of alcohol consumption by blocking the opioid receptors in the brain, which are involved in the pleasure and reward pathways. This reduction in the rewarding effects of alcohol can decrease the urge to drink and help maintain abstinence. Both daily naltrexone and long-acting injectable naltrexone have strong evidence for their use as they have been shown to improve numerous drinking outcomes, including a return to any drinking and a return to heavy drinking.⁹⁵

Naltrexone generally is well tolerated, although it has the potential to precipitate severe opioid withdrawal in patients who are opioid dependent. Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, headaches, dizziness, fatigue, anxiety, and somnolence, with nausea and vomiting the most frequently reported.
