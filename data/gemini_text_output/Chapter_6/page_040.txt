302 IC&RC Alcohol and Drug Counselor (ADC) Certification Examination Study Guide

**EVIDENCE-BASED APPROACHES TO SUSTAIN RECOVERY**

Throughout this study guide, the four major domains that support a life in recovery have been stressed: health, home, purpose, and community. Counselors can help clients recovering from SUDs to promote a healthy life by connecting them with a range of tools and resources that have been found to be effective within these domains. This means getting the basics right, making sure that people have access to the material resources and supports they need—things such as money, food, housing, transport, physical health care, personal safety. However, it also involves going beyond mere survival and should be about enabling people to make the most of their lives, accessing those activities, roles, and relationships that they value.¹¹⁴

Counselors can support people in recovery by partnering with the many and varied community organizations available, or with a health care provider or case manager who can offer resources to encourage skill building in these four domains (see Chapter 7. Case Management for details on partnering). This support can help optimize autonomy and independence, allowing clients to lead, manage, and exercise choice over decisions that support their long-term recovery. Building skills in these four domains also increases a client’s resilience, or their ability to cope with life’s challenges, and be better prepared for the next stressful situation.¹¹⁵

**Health**

Managing physical health, especially chronic conditions, in individuals with SUDs involves integrating evidence-based practices that address both the substance use and the chronic health condition. As presented in Chapter 3, many chronic health conditions are intertwined with SUDs – HIV, hepatitis, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, tobacco use, to name a few. Because of the diversity of these health conditions, multidisciplinary care teams, including physicians, nurses, psychologists, and counselors, often work together to create and implement a comprehensive care plan. It is beyond the scope of this study guide to direct learners to such a variety of potential EBPs that address specific diseases or conditions.

Self-management in chronic
diseases is defined as “the
individual’s ability to manage the
symptoms, treatment, physical and
psychosocial consequences and
lifestyle changes inherent in living
with a chronic condition.”¹¹⁸

There are numerous programs, however, in the category of Self-
Management Support (SMS) programs that engage individuals in their
own care as a strategy for integrated person-centered health services.
These programs emphasize patient/client responsibility for working with
health care providers to learn about and actively identify challenges
and solve problems associated with their chronic health conditions. In
addition, these programs are evidence-based and have been shown to
be effective in managing a wide range of chronic conditions, including
diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory conditions, and mental
health disorders (MHD).¹¹⁶

A 2023 systematic review of published research on SMS programs found
many similarities among the programs. Although there are differences
based on the disease or condition, most SMS programs have mixed
interventions with strategies aimed at education, patient activation and health coaching, physical activity,
support (incl. providing feedback) and counseling, problem identification/solving, decision-making, self-
monitoring, reinforcing support tools, lifestyle adaptations, and goal setting/developing action plans. Research
found positive outcomes associated with educational interventions, patient activation and health coaching
interventions, physical interventions, and lifestyle components.⁸

SUD counselors can support long-term health and well-being by offering resources in general about the benefits
of a healthy diet, regular exercise, and healthy sleep habits. Counselors can also research available SMS programs
in their area or online and link clients to preventive and primary care services.
