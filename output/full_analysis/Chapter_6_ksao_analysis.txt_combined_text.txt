**INTRODUCTION**

The landscape of SUD treatment has been significantly shaped by the integration of evidence-based practices (EBPs). Evidence-based practices are interventions for which there is consistent scientific evidence showing that they improve client outcomes.¹ EBPs are essential because they provide structured, tested approaches that can be replicated and measured across different settings, ensuring that clients receive the highest standard of care. By integrating scientific research into clinical practice, counselors can offer treatments that are not only effective but also tailored to meet the unique needs of individuals with substance use disorders.

The categorization of a program or practice as an EBP is determined through a systematic process of reviewing and applying the existing research findings to guide clinical decision-making. The determination of the effectiveness of behavioral health interventions relies on many evidence types. Here is an overview of the primary types of evidence used in evaluating interventions:²

Underneath "TIP65", on a lighter background section, is the text "Counseling Approaches To Promote Recovery From Problematic Substance Use and Related Issues". The bottom section of the cover is dark and features the SAMHSA logo, which includes the text "SAMHSA" in large white letters, and below it, "Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration" in smaller white letters.]

Many SAMHA TIP documents were
used in this chapter as source materials.
This latest TIP (2023, Nov.) contains
significant detail about recovery
oriented-counseling and specific
evidence-based treatment practices.
While this current study guide chapter
summarizes prevailing evidence-based
practices, this TIP provides more
detailed descriptions for those who are
interested.

» **Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs):** RCTs are considered
the gold standard for evaluating the efficacy of interventions
under controlled conditions. They involve randomly assigning
participants to either the intervention group or the control
group to compare outcomes directly attributable to the
intervention.

» **Observational Studies:** These include cohort studies, case-
control studies, and cross-sectional studies. Observational
studies are used to assess the effectiveness of interventions
in real-world settings. They can provide valuable information
about the applicability of interventions across different
populations and settings.

» **Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses:** These synthesize
findings from multiple studies to provide an overview of the
evidence regarding the effectiveness of an intervention. Meta-
analyses use statistical methods to combine data from several
studies, increasing the power to detect effects and providing a
more reliable estimate of the intervention’s effectiveness.

» **Qualitative Evidence:** Though not quantitative, qualitative
evidence from interviews, focus groups, and case studies can
provide insights into how and why an intervention works,
the context in which it is most effective, and the barriers and
facilitators to its implementation. This type of evidence can
complement quantitative findings and help tailor interventions
to specific populations or settings.

» **Client-Reported Outcomes:** Data generated by clients
themselves, regarding their health status, treatment
adherence, and quality of life, can be crucial for assessing the
effectiveness of interventions from their perspective.

It is fortunate that a broad range of evidence-based treatments
for alcohol, tobacco, opioid, and other SUDs are available.⁶ These
are broadly categorized as motivational, cognitive-behavioral, and
mindfulness-based approaches that can be delivered in individual
and group formats and family treatments, as well as incorporated[Layout: Single column page with a header and a right sidebar. The left edge of the page shows a spiral binding graphic.]

with medication-assisted treatment (also termed pharmacotherapy or MAT).4 Regardless of the substance for
which the individual seeks treatment or the setting or level of care, all SUD treatment programs are expected to
offer an individualized set of evidence-based clinical components. Treatment programs that offer more of these
evidence-based components have the greatest likelihood of producing better outcomes.5

EBP Implementation Issues

The implementation of EBPs is a complex process, such that the term
implementation science has been coined to encompass the many issues
that can affect successful implementation. Implementation science
focuses on the study of methods to promote the systematic movement
of research findings and evidence-based practices (EBPs) into routine
practice. An exploration of this science is beyond the purpose of this
study guide, however, there are a few critical points to be highlighted.

Most EBPs require comprehensive training and supervision. It is essential
that SUD counselors get trained in the chosen evidence-based practices,
thereby maximizing their effectiveness in treating clients. Effective
counselor training goes beyond initial instruction to include ongoing
support mechanisms, such as supervision and consultation, to ensure
that EBPs are implemented correctly in practice settings.

Training helps ensure that interventions are delivered with **fidelity**.
Fidelity has been defined as the extent to which an intervention was
delivered as conceived and planned, to arrive at effectiveness in achieving
the target outcomes.6 High fidelity to EBPs is crucial because it ensures
that the interventions delivered in practice mirror those proven effective
in research. This adherence maximizes the likelihood that clients will
receive the full benefits of the interventions.7

There can be significant implementation failure if programs and/or practices are not delivered with fidelity.
Fidelity can be lost when service providers fail to apply the techniques of the evidence-based practice as they
were trained. Programs often lose their fidelity to new protocols over time or when they are implemented in
unique settings. It is best to measure fidelity through multiple approaches. Fidelity checklists can be used;
these checklists identify the critical components of an approach and delineate those that are essential and non-
essential to program integrity. A variety of other monitoring activities can also be applied such as supervisor
observation and use of videotaping or audio recording for supervision of the intervention sessions.8

Another implementation issue is "fit." Fit refers to how well a program matches, or is appropriate for, the
community, organization, stakeholders, and potential participants. It is important to address the concerns that
some EBPs are not culturally appropriate or otherwise a good "fit" for specific populations. Imposing EBPs
when they do not consider the perspectives of a specific population may result in clients' lack of interest or
engagement in the treatment program. While the best fit is desired, encouraging strict fidelity to the EBP during
implementation can limit both a practitioner's ability to be person-centered or culturally appropriate and the
opportunity for practitioners to learn from adaptations that may improve outcomes.9

**BEHAVIORAL TREATMENTS -**
**MOTIVATIONAL INTERVIEWING**

Motivational approaches, particularly **Motivational Interviewing (MI)**, have been extensively applied across a spectrum of SUD treatments, offering a flexible and effective strategy for engaging clients in behavior change. The use of motivational approaches shows the shift towards more empathetic, client-centered care. By focusing on the individual’s motivations and strengths, these approaches not only help with engagement and retention in treatment but also empower clients to take active roles in their recovery.

Motivational Interviewing (MI) is a client-centered, directive method for enhancing personal motivation to change by exploring and resolving ambivalence.¹⁰ MI began in substance use treatment in the early 1980’s. At that time, the prevailing view and strategy in addressing problematic substance use was one of confrontation as an “intervention.” The introduction of MI was truly an innovation because it created a shift in the underlying philosophy of care. This motivational approach has been proven over the last three decades to have more lasting effects than the intervention method. Helping professionals are drawn to MI for a variety of reasons:

1. The aspects, principles, and values of MI are like those that guide and are embraced by a wide range of helping professionals.

2. MI has a rich body of evidence that supports its use with populations at risk and individuals seeking mental health and substance use disorder treatment.

3. MI has been found to be effective in clients from diverse backgrounds and settings and seems to fit well with concepts of cultural competency.¹¹

4. MI is a flexible approach as a stand-alone or in combination with other interventions.¹²

MI is more than the use of a set of technical interventions. It is characterized by a particular “spirit” or “way of being” with others which is the context or interpersonal relationship within which the techniques are employed. Central to the spirit of MI is having an attitude of **acceptance** of what the individual brings to the table.

MI is a useful approach when: 1) a person is ambivalent about change; 2) the focus is on building trust and rapport; 3) part of one’s job involves encouraging and supporting others in making changes; and, 4) the job involves working with people who might be referred to as being “difficult” or “resistant to change.”¹³ In Chapter 4, the concept of ambivalence was introduced. As a reminder – **ambivalence** refers to the mixed feelings or conflicting attitudes a person has towards change. It is a central concept in MI, reflecting the natural human experience of being torn between continuing a certain behavior and the desire to change that behavior. Ambivalence is viewed not as a barrier to change, but as a normal and expected aspect of the change process.

Ambivalence is seen as something to be explored and resolved through therapeutic **conversations**. MI is fundamentally a conversation about change. Counselors use MI techniques to help clients examine their ambivalent feelings. The goal is to assist clients in moving towards resolving their ambivalence in favor of change that aligns with their deeper values and goals. Understanding and addressing ambivalence is crucial in MI, as it directly influences a person’s motivation and readiness to change. By acknowledging and working through ambivalence, MI facilitates a supportive environment where clients can find their own motivation for making meaningful changes in their lives.CHAPTER 6: Evidence-based Practices 267

**The Spirit of MI⁴**

The Spirit of Motivational Interviewing (MI) is the foundational mindset that underlies the practice of MI and guides its application. It has four key elements: **partnership, acceptance, compassion,** and **evocation**. These elements represent the heart of MI and distinguish it from other therapeutic approaches by focusing on how counselors relate to their clients.

» **Partnership.** MI is characterized by a collaborative partnership between the counselor and the client. Rather than positioning the counselor as an expert who imposes advice, MI models working together as equals. This partnership is built on mutual respect and the understanding that the client is the expert on their own life.

» **Acceptance** involves acknowledging and respecting the client's worth, potential, and autonomy. It includes several aspects: absolute worth (unconditional positive regard), empathy (an active interest in and effort to understand the client's perspective), autonomy support (honoring the client's right to make their own choices), and affirmation (recognizing and reinforcing the client's strengths and efforts).

» **Compassion** in MI means prioritizing the client's welfare and needs in a selfless manner. It involves actively promoting the client's well-being and taking actions that are intended to benefit the client. This genuine concern for the client's welfare drives the therapeutic process.

» **Evocation** is the practice of drawing out the client's own motivations and resources for change rather than imposing external motives. It is based on the belief that clients already possess the values, desires, and abilities necessary for change, and the counselor's role is to help bring these to the forefront.

The Spirit of MI is crucial for creating a supportive and empowering environment that facilitates change. It is not just about using specific techniques but about adopting an overall stance that promotes engagement, exploration, and growth. By embracing the Spirit of MI, counselors can more effectively motivate clients toward positive change, making it a powerful approach in the treatment of substance use disorders and beyond.

**Principles and Skill Sets of Motivational Interviewing¹⁵**

MI is grounded in four central principles that guide the therapeutic process. These principles are not just techniques but represent the philosophical approach to engaging with clients.

**1. Expressing Empathy**

Empathy is the cornerstone of MI, involving a deep understanding of the client’s perspective and feelings without judgment. It requires active listening and reflecting, allowing clients to feel heard and understood. This empathetic engagement helps to build rapport and trust, essential components in the therapeutic relationship.

**2. Developing Discrepancy**

MI proposes that change occurs when individuals perceive a discrepancy (meaning an unexpected difference) between their current behavior and their broader goals or values. Developing discrepancy starts with the counselor listening closely to the individual’s core beliefs, values, and goals; and then, using MI skills, help them explore the discrepancies between what is important to them and their current behavior. Succinctly, counselors help clients explore discrepancies to arrive at motivation for change.

**3. Supporting Self-Efficacy**

MI emphasizes the belief in the client’s ability and right to change. Counselors focus on reinforcing the client’s strengths, past successes, and potential for change, boosting their confidence in their ability to achieve their goals.

**Scaling rulers** are tools used in MI to assess readiness, confidence, and importance of change. They offer a structured method for exploring and resolving ambivalence, thereby enhancing the client’s motivation for change. Regarding self-efficacy, clients are asked to rate their confidence in their ability to make the desired change, on a scale from 0 to 10. This assesses the client’s self-efficacy and can highlight potential obstacles or supports needed to increase confidence in making a change. The counselor can explore the reasons behind the client’s current level of confidence and discuss what resources or strategies might improve it.

[Image: A horizontal scale ranging from 0 to 10. The left end, at 0, is labeled "Not Confident". The right end, at 10, is labeled "Extremely Confident". The scale has tick marks and labels for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. The bar is shaded with a gradient from dark on the left to lighter in the middle and then darker again towards the right, with the numbers clearly visible.]

**Not Confident** **Extremely Confident**

**4. Respond to Sustain Talk and Discord**

The fourth principle was initially “Rolling with Resistance”; however, in the 3rd edition of Motivational Interviewing, Miller and Rollnick shifted from the principle of “Rolling with Resistance” to the more closely refined concepts of “Responding to Sustain Talk” and “Discord.” Originally, “Rolling with Resistance” emphasized a non-confrontational approach to client resistance by moving fluidly with the client’s objections or reluctance. However, as MI practitioners gained experience and research in the field expanded, it became clear that the concept of “resistance” could imply a problematic dynamic between the counselor and client, suggesting opposition or combativeness. To address this, MI evolved to focus more on the new principles that offer a more collaborative and empathetic approach to the challenges of change.

» **Sustain Talk** refers to the client’s verbal expressions that favor the status quo or reasons against change. It is a natural part of the ambivalence that many clients experience. Instead of viewing such expressions as resistance to be overcome, MI views them as important information that can guide the therapeutic process.CHAPTER 6: Evidence-based Practices 269

» **Discord,** on the other hand, describes tension or a lack of harmony in the client–counselor relationship. It might arise from a mismatch in goals, a breakdown in communication, or perceived lack of empathy. Recognizing and addressing discord is crucial for maintaining a productive therapeutic alliance.

The shift underscores the importance of understanding and empathetically engaging with the client’s perspective. Here are some strategies that can be used to augment this principle:

[Image: A black and white photograph showing two individuals in what appears to be a counseling session. One person, possibly a counselor, is seen from the back, sitting and facing the other individual. The second individual, likely the client, is seated on a couch, facing the first person and gesturing with their hands while speaking. The client is wearing a patterned shirt and appears engaged in conversation.]

» **Reflecting on Sustain Talk:** Instead of challenging sustain talk, counselors reflect it back to the client, helping them hear their own ambivalence and explore it further.

» **Exploring Values:** Counselors help clients explore their values and how the change aligns with these, often revealing discrepancies that motivate change.

» **Adjusting to Discord:** When discord arises, counselors strive to understand its source and adjust their approach, often by expressing empathy, validating the client’s feelings, and reaffirming their autonomy.

**OARS SKILLS**¹⁶

MI employs several core communication strategies known as the OARS skills. The acronym stands for Open-ended Questions, Affirmations, Reflective Listening, and Summarizing. Understanding and effectively using OARS can significantly enhance the engagement and motivation of clients in SUD counseling.

**Open-ended Questions** are designed to encourage clients to explore their thoughts and feelings without a simple ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer. They invite elaboration and provide the counselor with valuable insights into the client’s perspectives, motivations, and ambivalence.

**Example:**

**Counselor:** “What brought you here today?”

**Client:** “I guess I’ve been feeling like my drinking is starting to affect my job and family.”

**Counselor:** “It sounds like you’ve noticed some important areas being impacted. Can you tell me more about that?”

This open-ended question encourages the client to reflect on their substance use and its consequences, facilitating deeper exploration of their concerns.

**Affirmations** are statements that recognize clients’ strengths, efforts, and successes. They are used to build confidence and reinforce positive self-regard, supporting the client’s belief in their ability to change.

**Example:**

**Client:** “I managed to stay sober at the party last night, even though it was really tough.”

**Counselor:** “That’s a significant achievement, showing a lot of strength and commitment to your goals.”

This affirmation validates the client’s effort and resilience, boosting their confidence and motivation.[Layout: Single column with a header. The right edge of the page shows a spiral binding.]

270 IC&RC Alcohol and Drug Counselor (ADC) Certification Examination Study Guide

**Reflective Listening** involves the counselor echoing back what the client has said, either by paraphrasing
or directly reflecting their words. This technique demonstrates that the counselor is actively listening and
understanding, helping to clarify and deepen the client's own understanding of their experiences and feelings.

**Example:**

**Client:** *"I feel like everyone is against me."*

**Counselor:** *"It sounds like you're feeling isolated and unsupported right now."*

Reflective listening here shows empathy and helps the client feel heard and understood, potentially
opening up more dialogue about these feelings.

**Summarizing** involves the counselor bringing together the key points of what the client has shared during the
session. It helps to highlight progress, reinforce shared understanding, and set the stage for moving forward.

**Example:**

**Counselor:** *"So today we've talked about how your drinking is starting to impact areas of your life that are
important to you, like your job and family. You've also shared a recent success in staying sober at a social event,
which shows your strength and commitment. What are your thoughts on the next steps?"*

Summarizing in this manner encapsulates the session's discussion, emphasizing both the challenges and
achievements, and prompts the client to think about future actions.

**FOCUSING AND ELICITING CHANGE TALK¹⁷** *[The superscript 17 is followed by two small, indistinct marks, possibly an apostrophe and a comma or period, or just print artifacts.]*

Focusing and eliciting change talk are fundamental components of MI that work hand in hand. Focusing ensures
that the conversation has direction and purpose, while the elicitation of change talk, guided by the DARN CAT
acronym, helps to strengthen the client's motivation for making those changes. Together, these strategies create
a powerful framework for facilitating meaningful and client-centered change.

Focusing involves identifying and maintaining a specific direction in conversations about change. It is about
finding and maintaining a shared goal or focus that guides the conversation. Focusing helps to clarify the
change that the client is considering, ensuring that both the counselor and the client are aligned in their
objectives.

**Implementing Focusing:**

1.  **Set the Agenda:** Begin by collaboratively setting an agenda that outlines what will be discussed. This
    helps to give the session structure and ensures that the client's priorities are front and center.

2.  **Explore Options:** Discuss various areas for potential change, allowing the client to express their thoughts
    and feelings about each.

3.  **Narrow the Focus:** Once various options have been explored, work together to decide on a specific focus
    for change. This is often the area where the client feels most motivated to work on.

4.  **Maintain Direction:** Keep the conversation on track by gently steering it back to the focus of change when
    it deviates.

**Example of Focusing Dialogue:**

**Counselor:** *"Considering what we've talked about, what area feels most pressing for you to address?"*

**Client:** *"I think I need to work on my drinking first. It's causing the most problems."*

**Counselor:** *"Alright, let's focus on understanding your relationship with alcohol and explore steps towards change."*[Layout: Single column page with a header. An image is present on the right side of the page, next to the text explaining the DARN CAT acronym and the "Eliciting Change Talk" section.]

CHAPTER 6: Evidence-based Practices 271

**ELICITING CHANGE TALK USING THE DARN CAT ACRONYM¹⁸**

Eliciting change talk is the key task of the evoking
process. Change talk is any client speech that leans
towards motivation for change, such as any discussion
of the desire, ability, reasons, need, and commitment
or taking steps to change. The DARN CAT acronym
represents types of change talk that counselors aim to
elicit:¹⁹

» **D**esire (wanting to change)
» **A**bility (being able to change)
» **R**easons (having reasons to change)
» **N**eed (feeling a necessity to change)
» **C**ommitment (committing to change)
» **A**ctivation (being ready to change)
» **T**aking steps (taking action towards change)

[Image: A black and white photograph of a tabby cat wearing dark sunglasses. The cat is looking directly at the camera. It is holding up a white rectangular sign with its paws (only the paws are visible holding the sign from below). The sign has the words "DARN" written above "CAT" in large, black, capital letters. The background is plain white. The image is placed to the right of the text describing the DARN CAT acronym.]

**Eliciting Change Talk:**

1.  **Ask Open-Ended Questions:** These encourage the
    client to express desire, ability, reasons, and need
    for change in their own words.

2.  **Use Affirmations:** Affirming strengths and past
    successes can bolster the client’s confidence in
    their ability to change, touching on ability and
    commitment.

3.  **Reflective Listening:** Reflect back change talk, amplifying the client’s own motivations and intentions.

4.  **Summarize:** Bring together the client’s expressions of change talk, reinforcing their commitment and
    steps they’re ready to take.

**Examples of Eliciting Change Talk:**

» **Desire:** “What makes you want to change your drinking habits?”
» **Ability:** “Can you tell me about a time when you successfully managed to resist the urge to drink?”
» **Reasons:** “How do you think your life might improve if you changed your relationship with alcohol?”
» **Need:** “How important is it for you to make this change now?”
» **Commitment:** “What steps are you willing to take to reduce your drinking?”
» **Activation:** “It sounds like you’re ready to start making some changes. What’s the first step you’d like to
take?”
» **Taking Steps:** “What have you already done towards making this change?”

It is important to note that, although one’s level of motivation is a great predictor of outcomes, change is a
complex process. To be successful, the person must believe change is important, have confidence they can be
successful at making the change, have the energy and be committed to work in the immediate future on the
target issue.272 IC&RC Alcohol and Drug Counselor (ADC) Certification Examination Study Guide

**THE PLANNING PHASE**

The Planning phase occurs after the processes of engaging, focusing, and evoking. This phase is dedicated to developing a concrete plan of action that guides the client toward their desired change. It involves collaboratively setting goals and strategies for change, based on the motivation and commitment the client has developed through the MI process. The Planning phase is essential for translating the client's desire, ability, reasons, and need for change into actionable steps through:

1.  **Collaborative Goal Setting:** The counselor and client work together to set achievable, specific, and meaningful goals. These goals are directly informed by the client's values and motivations for change that have been elicited in earlier conversations.
2.  **Developing a Plan of Action:** The next step is to outline a detailed plan for achieving them. This plan may include identifying specific actions, steps, or behaviors that the client will undertake. It also involves considering any potential barriers to change and strategies for overcoming them.
3.  **Strengthening Commitment:** This phase is also an opportunity to strengthen the client's commitment to their goals. This can involve discussing the importance of the change, the client's confidence in their ability to achieve it, and affirming their commitment to taking action.
4.  **Flexible and Client-Centered:** Plans developed during this phase are flexible and can be revised as needed. It's important that the plan is client-centered and considers the client's preferences, lifestyle, and unique circumstances. Counselors can help clients move forward with confidence and increase the likelihood of sustained change.

**EXAMPLE OF PLANNING DIALOGUE**

**Counselor:** "Based on what we've discussed, it seems like reducing your alcohol intake is a priority for you. What are some specific steps you feel ready to take towards this goal?"

**Client:** "I think I could start by not drinking on weekdays."

**Counselor:** "That sounds like a clear and manageable step. How confident do you feel about implementing this change starting next week?"

**Client:** "Pretty confident, I guess. I could use some strategies for what to do when I get the urge to drink, though."

**Counselor:** "Let's explore some strategies together. We can also consider who in your life might support you in this change."

**Other Evidence-Based Practices Using a Motivational Approach**

**CONTINGENCY MANAGEMENT**

**Contingency Management (CM)**²⁰ is one of the most effective behavioral interventions for problematic substance use. CM provides incentives to change behavior. Unlike MI techniques, which are based on an individual's intrinsic motivation (i.e., motivation that arises from within), CM strategies are based on extrinsic motivation (i.e., motivation derived from sources outside the individual). By incentivizing goal attainment and treatment adherence with tangible rewards, CM addresses the immediate reinforcement that substance use provides. This method's success is significantly increased when paired with motivational strategies that help clients internalize the desire for change. By understanding the personal values and goals of the client, counselors can tailor CM rewards in a way that better aligns with the individual's motivations, leading to sustained behavior change.²¹CHAPTER 6: Evidence-based Practices 273

CM is most often used with individuals in recovery from stimulants, such as cocaine, methamphetamine, and
prescription stimulants. CM also has evidence as an effective treatment for alcohol, cannabis, and tobacco use
disorders and as an effective adjunctive intervention to medications for opioid use disorder.22 CM can be used
to identify healthy alternatives to problematic substance use and grow recovery strengths. For example, CM
approaches aim to sustain client engagement in treatment and promote recovery by providing positive incentives
to clients who engage in and sustain behavioral changes, such as abstinence from alcohol or drugs; medication
adherence; attendance at continuing care groups, mutual-help groups, or 12-Step recovery meetings; or
maintenance of a job or stable housing arrangement.

The goal of CM is to increase desired behaviors by providing immediate reinforcers when a specific behavior
occurs and withholding reinforcers when that behavior does not occur. Reinforcers are provided in the form of
tangible incentives that are often administered in two forms:23

1.  **Voucher-based reinforcement:** This type of incentive uses vouchers that have monetary value. Individuals
    earn vouchers for meeting specific treatment goals, such as submitting drug-free urine samples or
    attending therapy sessions. These vouchers have a monetary value and can be exchanged for goods or
    services that support healthy living, such as gym memberships, educational materials, or grocery items.
    The value of the vouchers typically increases with consecutive achievements to encourage sustained
    behavior change.

2.  **Prize incentives:** Direct financial incentives involve providing
    cash or cash-equivalent rewards to individuals for meeting
    specific treatment milestones. Similar to vouchers, the
    magnitude and frequency of rewards are often contingent on
    continuous achievement. This type of CM traditionally uses a
    “fishbowl model,” where clients draw a piece of paper out of
    a large bowl. On some pieces of paper are reaffirming phrases,
    such as “well done.” On others, there will be small cash prizes,
    and on one piece of paper will be the “jumbo” prize. Clients can
    increase their number of chances to win each time they achieve
    a specific behavior. However, if a recovery task is not completed,
    the chance to win resets to one.

[Image: A black and white, slightly grainy, medium shot photograph of a man. He is smiling broadly with his mouth open, looking directly at the camera. He has a dark beard and mustache, and is wearing a dark beanie hat. He is also wearing a light-colored, possibly denim, open jacket or shirt over a darker, buttoned-up shirt. His arms are bent and his hands are not fully visible but appear to be holding the lapels of his outer garment or are tucked into it. The background is plain and light-colored. The image is positioned on the right side of the page, next to the description of "Prize incentives."]

Tailoring the incentive program to individual preferences and needs
is crucial for maximizing engagement and effectiveness. This might
involve allowing individuals to choose their rewards within a certain
framework or adjusting the size and frequency of rewards to match
individual treatment milestones. Implementing CM requires careful consideration to avoid potential ethical
pitfalls, such as creating undue inducement or encouraging material dependence. Clear guidelines and limits on
the value and type of incentives can help mitigate these concerns.

While CM is powerful, it is most effective when integrated into a broader treatment plan that includes
psychological and medical support. This ensures that the root causes of addiction are addressed alongside the
behavioral aspects of substance use.

**Community Reinforcement Approach with Vouchers (CRA-V)**

The **Community Reinforcement Approach (CRA)**, originally developed for individuals with alcohol use disorders,
has been successfully employed to treat a variety of substance use disorders for more than 35 years. CRA helps
people rearrange their lifestyles so that healthy, drug-free living becomes rewarding and thereby competes with
substance use. Counselors encourage clients to become progressively involved in alternative non-substance-
related pleasant social activities, and to work on enhancing the enjoyment they receive within the “community”
of their family and job. There are three variations of CRA that are based on the same operant mechanism.
The first variant is Adolescent Community Reinforcement Approach (A-CRA), which targets adolescents with274 IC&RC Alcohol and Drug Counselor (ADC) Certification Examination Study Guide

substance use problems and their caregivers. The second approach, Community Reinforcement and Family Training (CRAFT), works through family members to engage treatment-refusing individuals into treatment.²⁴

The third variation of CRA blended features from Contingency Management to add a voucher system (CRA-V). This enhanced the effectiveness of CRA by providing immediate and tangible incentives for substance-free behavior.²⁵ This integration was based on principles of operant conditioning, which suggest that behavior is more likely to be repeated when it is immediately followed by a positive reinforcement. The voucher aspect in CRA-V serves as a direct and measurable reinforcement for specific targeted behaviors, such as abstaining from substance use (verified by negative drug tests), attending therapy sessions, or participating in vocational and recreational activities. Clients earn vouchers for each verified instance of the targeted behavior, and these vouchers can be exchanged for goods or services that are consistent with a drug-free lifestyle, such as gym memberships, movie tickets, or educational courses.

This system of tangible rewards complements the broader CRA strategies by providing an immediate and material incentive for clients to be abstinent and engage in treatment activities. The vouchers serve to:

» Enhance Motivation: The immediate reward of vouchers increases the client's motivation to engage in treatment and maintain sobriety.
» Establish New Behavior Patterns: Regular reinforcement through vouchers helps in establishing new, healthier behavior patterns that replace substance use.
» Provide Positive Feedback: The voucher system offers a clear and positive feedback mechanism that reinforces the client's progress in treatment.

The addition of vouchers to CRA addresses one of the critical challenges in treating SUDs – maintaining motivation for behavior change, especially in the early stages of recovery.CHAPTER 6: Evidence-based Practices 275

**BEHAVIORAL TREATMENTS –**
**COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL APPROACHES**

Cognitive-behavioral approaches are the most common, evidence-based treatments for individuals who have problematic substance use.²⁶ The cognitive-behavioral model assumes that individuals are continually interpreting and responding to information perceived from their internal and external environments. Individuals develop representations of their environments in the form of thoughts, attitudes, and beliefs. These representations can affect how individuals feel and behave. When representations of the environment are inaccurate or unhelpful, they can be examined, challenged, and modified. As clients learn to reevaluate situations and develop helpful thinking patterns, they may notice that they feel better and make healthier behavior choices.

Cognitive-behavioral approaches are based on social learning theory, such that substance use occurs in the context of learned behavior (i.e., modeling, classical and operant conditioning).²⁷ As patterns of problematic substance use emerge, individuals have more difficulties coping with distressing thoughts and emotions. Multiple variations of SUD treatment interventions use components of the cognitive-behavioral framework, including the relapse prevention model, guided self-change, and the community reinforcement approach.²⁸

In recovery, the cognitive-behavioral model focuses on helping clients replace thinking patterns and risk behaviors that undermine recovery efforts with thinking and behavioral patterns that support and sustain recovery. Cognitive changes that support recovery from problematic substance use vary according to the substance used, but generally emphasize challenging or deconstructing positive beliefs about substance use or engaging in other risk behaviors and negative beliefs about identity that decrease self-efficacy.

**Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)²⁹**

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a widely used, evidence-based approach. CBT is supported by a vast amount of research evidence showing its effectiveness in treating a wide range of disorders, including depression, anxiety, PTSD, and substance use disorders. CBT has also been found to be adaptable to different cultures, age groups, and used through various delivery methods (individual sessions, group therapy, online platforms). It is a problem-oriented strategy that focuses on current problems and finding solutions for them. While understanding the historical roots of psychological problems is considered, CBT primarily focuses on current challenges and practical solutions.

The core premises of CBT revolve around the interconnectedness of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and the impact of cognitive (thought) processes on emotional well-being and action. The following foundational principles guide the therapeutic process, aiming to provide individuals with the tools to modify their thinking patterns to achieve more positive outcomes.³⁰

1.  **Interconnectedness of Thoughts, Feelings, and Behaviors:** At the heart of CBT is the belief that our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are deeply interconnected. This means that negative thoughts can lead to negative emotions and behaviors, and vice versa. By identifying and addressing maladaptive thought patterns, CBT can alter emotional states and behaviors in a positive way.

2.  **Cognitive Distortions:** CBT suggests that psychological distress is often due to cognitive distortions which are inaccurate or exaggerated thought patterns. Examples include “overgeneralization,” “catastrophizing,” and “personalization.” These thoughts can lead to a distorted view of oneself, others, and the world, contributing to emotional distress and maladaptive behaviors. For people with SUDs, cognitive distortions bring them closer to situations where temptation is strong and difficult to resist. CBT helps them lessen the power of cognitive distortions by teaching them how to slow down their thinking process and identify steps leading up to a decision.276 IC&RC Alcohol and Drug Counselor (ADC) Certification Examination Study Guide

3. **Automatic Thoughts:** CBT emphasizes the role of automatic thoughts, which are spontaneous, often unnoticed thoughts that can have a significant impact on mood and behavior. These thoughts can be irrational or negative and are considered a key target for intervention in CBT. For example, “If I refuse to use Molly with my friends, they won’t like me or think I am a wuss.”³⁰

4. **The Role of Schema:** Schemas are deeply held beliefs and assumptions about oneself, others, and the world. CBT suggests that dysfunctional schemas can lead to persistent negative thought patterns and behaviors. Counseling may involve identifying and challenging these core beliefs to effect change.

5. **Behavioral Techniques:** Cognitive restructuring is a technique aimed at identifying, challenging, and ultimately altering maladaptive patterns. Alongside this technique, CBT also incorporates behavioral techniques to change patterns of behavior that maintain or worsen substance use or psychological problems. This includes techniques like exposure therapy for anxiety disorders, where individuals gradually confront their fears, or behavioral activation for depression, which encourages engagement in enjoyable activities.

6. **Empowerment through Skill Development:** CBT empowers individuals by teaching them coping skills for dealing with different types of psychological distress. These skills include problem-solving, assertiveness training, mindfulness, and relaxation techniques. The aim is for individuals' have the ability to apply these skills as needed to manage future challenges.

7. **Evidence-Based Approach:** A fundamental premise of CBT is its grounding in empirical evidence. It is a scientifically validated approach, with numerous studies supporting its efficacy in treating a wide range of psychological disorders.

8. **Goal Orientation and Collaborative Nature:** CBT is goal-oriented and collaborative. Counseling sessions have a structure and focus on achieving specific outcomes. The counselor and client work together to identify goals, explore and understand problems, and develop strategies for overcoming them.

9. **Adaptability and Flexibility:** While CBT has a set of core principles, it is also adaptable to the individual needs of the client. Counselors can tailor the approach to address the specific problems and goals of each individual, making it flexible and personalized.

**COGNITIVE RESTRUCTURING**

A fundamental technique in CBT is called cognitive restructuring. Cognitive restructuring aims to identify, challenge, and ultimately alter maladaptive, distorted, or negative thought patterns (cognitive distortions) that contribute to psychological distress. This process involves several steps:³¹

1. **Identification of Maladaptive Thoughts:** The first step in cognitive restructuring is to help individuals become aware of their automatic thoughts—the spontaneous, often critical, and negative thoughts that arise in response to specific situations. These thoughts are usually accepted as true by the individual, despite being based on assumptions or misconceptions.

2. **Evaluation of Thoughts:** Once these thoughts are identified, the individual is encouraged to evaluate them critically, assessing their accuracy and helpfulness. This might involve looking for evidence that supports or contradicts these thoughts, considering alternative interpretations of the situation, or assessing the likelihood of feared outcomes happening.

3. **Challenge Distorted Thoughts:** The counselor and client work together to challenge the validity of distorted or irrational thoughts. This might involve questioning the evidence for these thoughts, examining their logical basis, or testing their validity through experimentation or observation.

4. **Development of Alternative Thoughts:** After challenging the maladaptive thoughts, the next step is to develop more balanced, realistic thoughts to replace them. These alternative thoughts are based on a more accurate assessment of the situation and are typically less extreme and more flexible than the original thoughts.CHAPTER 6: Evidence-based Practices 277

**5. Integration of New Thoughts:** The individual is encouraged to integrate these new, more adaptive thoughts into their daily thinking patterns. This involves practicing and reinforcing these thoughts in various situations, leading to changes in emotional responses and behaviors.

**Cognitive Restructuring Example:**

In this scenario, the counselor helps the client through the process of cognitive restructuring to enhance his refusal skills in situations where cocaine use is involved.

**Counselor:** “You’ve mentioned feeling worried about being able to refuse cocaine if it’s offered to you again. Can you share what thoughts come to mind in those moments?”

**Client:** “I keep thinking that if I say no, my friends will think I’m boring or judge me. It feels like I’ll lose them if I don’t participate.”

**Counselor:** “That sounds like a challenging situation. The thought that your friends will think less of you for refusing cocaine seems to be quite distressing. Would you consider this an automatic thought?”

**Client:** “Yeah, it hits me every time I’m in that situation.”

**Counselor:** “Let’s take a moment to examine that thought. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that your friends will think you’re boring or judge you for saying no?”

**Client:** “I don’t know, really. I guess I’ve never actually said no before, so I’m not sure how they’d react.”

**Counselor:** “I see. It’s based more on the anticipation of a reaction. How about evidence against that thought? Have you had experiences where you’ve made a choice for your health or safety, and it was respected?”

**Client:** “Well, there have been times when I’ve chosen not to drink because I was driving, and my friends were okay with it. They didn’t think I was boring then.”

**Counselor:** “That’s a valuable observation. It shows that your friends can understand and respect your choices. How might we reframe your original thought into something that can help you?”

**Client:** “Maybe I could think, ‘If I refuse cocaine and explain my reasons, my true friends will understand and respect my decision, just like when I’ve chosen not to drink.’”

**Counselor:** “That’s a more positive thought. How does it feel to think in that way?”

**Client:** “Less stressful, actually. It makes me feel like I have more control over the situation.”

**Counselor:** “I’m glad to hear that. Remember, thinking this way can help you to act in ways that support your goals for recovery. Once you have practiced this kind of thinking and response, it can help build your confidence in refusing cocaine, regardless of the situation.”

This conversation illustrates the cognitive restructuring process tailored to improving the client’s refusal skills in the context of cocaine use. By identifying, challenging, and reframing the client’s automatic negative thought, the client begins to see a more balanced perspective.278 IC&RC Alcohol and Drug Counselor (ADC) Certification Examination Study Guide

**CBT STRUCTURED THERAPEUTIC ACTIVITIES**

CBT is not only interactive and collaborative but also highly structured. A key aspect of its structure involves the use of workbooks, homework assignments, and other practical tools designed to facilitate the cognitive restructuring process and reinforce the skills learned during therapeutic sessions. This structure is instrumental in helping individuals apply CBT principles to their daily lives, enhancing the therapy’s effectiveness and promoting long-term improvement.

**Workbooks** are the foundation of CBT’s structured approach. They typically contain educational material, exercises, and worksheets that guide individuals through the process of identifying, evaluating, and challenging their negative thoughts and beliefs. These workbooks serve as a resource for clients to learn more about the CBT model, understand their patterns of thinking and behavior, and systematically work through exercises designed to foster change. They are particularly useful for individuals to reference outside of counseling sessions, allowing continuous engagement with the therapeutic process.

**Homework** is another integral component of CBT’s structure, emphasizing the application of skills learned in counseling to real-life situations. Homework assignments may include:³²

» **Practice exercises:** Activities designed to reinforce cognitive restructuring techniques, such as recording and analyzing automatic thoughts or practicing alternative responses to challenging situations.

» **Behavioral experiments:** Tasks that encourage individuals to test the validity of their beliefs in real-world settings, helping to gather evidence against cognitive distortions.

» **Exposure tasks:** Specifically for individuals with anxiety disorders, assignments might involve gradual, controlled exposure to feared objects or situations to reduce avoidance behaviors and fear responses.

» **Skill-building activities:** Assignments aimed at enhancing specific skills, like assertiveness, communication, or problem-solving, relevant to the individual’s therapeutic goals.

CBT sessions often begin with a review of the homework from the previous session. Progress tracking, using thought records, mood logs, or behavior charts, is a critical part of this process. It provides tangible evidence of change over time and helps to identify areas that may require further attention. This structured approach facilitates the internalization of cognitive-behavioral techniques and equips them with the tools necessary for managing challenges and maintaining mental health gains long after the therapy has concluded.³³

**Other Practices that Use Cognitive Behavioral Therapy as a Foundation**

CBT’s value is not only in its direct application but also in its influence on the development of other therapeutic approaches, such as Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), and others which incorporate its cognitive-behavioral principles. These therapies adapt and expand upon the foundational principles of CBT, tailoring them to specific conditions, populations, or treatment philosophies.

**DIALECTICAL BEHAVIOR THERAPY (DBT)**

Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) is an evidence-based treatment initially developed by Marsha Linehan for individuals with borderline personality disorder, particularly those with a history of suicidal behavior.³⁴ At its core, DBT is a form of CBT. It extends CBT by including acceptance-based strategies, such as validation, mindfulness (derived from Zen Buddhism), and

[Image: A black and white, grainy photograph of a person from the chest up, out of focus, looking down. Their hands are clasped in front of their face, and they are wearing a patterned sweater.

The main content is in a single column on the left, and there is a sidebar on the right containing a list. A page number is in the top right corner of the header.]

CHAPTER 6: Evidence-based Practices 279

reciprocal communication. Validation strategies are used to communicate
what the client is thinking and feeling, and to demonstrate acceptance of
the client’s efforts to change problematic behaviors. The purpose of these
acceptance practices is to help the client learn how to both self-validate
as well as tolerate their current experiences more effectively.³⁵ These
strategies are also designed to help both counselor and client accept one’s
life and present moment and become the focus of treatment.³⁶

The goal of DBT is to help clients develop a life worth living. DBT is
a comprehensive outpatient therapy with five functions designed to
help a client reach this goal: 1) improving motivation of the client to
change problem behaviors, 2) enhancing capabilities, 3) generalizing
new adaptive behavior to relevant life contexts, 4) structuring the
client’s environment to support new adaptive behavior, and 5) improving
motivation and capabilities of therapists. Therapeutic actions are
structured around: mindfulness, distress tolerance, emotion regulation,
and interpersonal effectiveness. Goals are to improve clients’ ability
to manage emotional distress, reduce self-destructive behaviors, and
enhance relationships. The modes of treatment in DBT, designed to
explicitly meet the five functions, include weekly individual counseling,
weekly skills training sessions, phone coaching as needed, and weekly
consultation with a team.³⁸ When DBT is successful, clients learn to
envision, articulate, pursue, and sustain goals that are independent of
their history of out-of-control behavior, including problematic substance
use, and are better able to grapple with life’s ordinary problems.³⁹ DBT’s
emphasis on building a life worth living is a broader therapeutic goal that
is consistent with recovery-oriented principles.

“Dialectical” is a puzzling word. According to the Oxford dictionary,
dialectical means - discovering the truth of ideas by discussion and
logical argument and by considering ideas that are opposed to each
other.⁴⁰ Dialectical philosophy is a method of philosophical argument
that emphasizes the process of contradiction and its resolution, which is
characterized by the tension between opposing forces, ideas, or elements.
This approach highlights the idea that conflict and contradiction are inherent in all things and that change and
development result from the struggle between opposing elements.⁴¹ In DBT, the synthesis of opposing forces is
central to fostering change and growth in individuals.

The DBT principles of behavioral science, acceptance, and dialectical philosophy are considered universal;
therefore, DBT is well-situated to be tailored to clients’ cultural contexts in application while remaining
adherent to the theories and values that are at the foundation of DBT.⁴²,⁴³ In addition, research has demonstrated
DBT’s efficacy across a variety of settings and populations, including individuals with substance use disorders⁴⁴,
eating disorders, depression, and ADHD, among others.⁴⁵,⁴⁶ Additional evidence-based practices that use CBT as a
foundation can be found in the Mindfulness-based Approaches and Trauma Approaches sections in this chapter.

**MINDFULNESS-BASED APPROACHES⁴⁷**

Helping clients develop proactive strategies
and improve their emotional regulation skills
is an important component of recovery.
Research indicates that stress—and how
an individual responds to stressors—can
be significant factors both in developing
problematic substance use and in recurrence.
As noted in Chapter 1, researchers have
identified certain aspects of the brain’s
response to stress that can predispose a
person to substance use and to the effects
that continued substance use can have on
executive function, decision making, and
inhibition control, which are factors that can
lead to recurrence.

**Mindfulness is a meditative coping strategy
that can increase a person’s ability to manage
stress and enhance emotional regulation.**
Mindfulness falls into the category of coping
skill strategies. Although mindfulness has its
origins in Eastern meditation and spiritual
traditions, Western treatment methods
have widely adapted it for recovery from
problematic substance use, SUDs and MHDs,
such as anxiety, depression, eating disorders,
PTSD, and borderline personality disorder. In
addition, mindfulness-based interventions
are culturally sensitive and have shown
promise with racial and ethnic minorities
and women.⁴⁸ Various approaches for treating
problematic substance use and preventing
recurrence feature mindfulness practices,
including Acceptance and Commitment
therapy (ACT), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), Mindfulness-based Relapse Prevention (MBRP), and
Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (MBSR). Mindfulness can help people manage cravings and urges, decrease
the likelihood of recurrence of depression and other mental health issues, and lower the desire to use substances
in response to negative emotions and cognitions.⁴⁹ Qualities of mindfulness include:

» Feeling alert but relaxed.
» Nonjudgmental awareness of the present moment.
» Kindness and compassion.
» Curiosity and acceptance about distressing or uncomfortable thoughts or sensations.

In practice, mindfulness is nonjudgmental, present-moment awareness of thoughts, mental images, feelings,
physical sensations, urges, and impulses. Mindfulness can be learned in formal meditation or practiced through
greater awareness of everyday activities, such as eating, walking, washing dishes, or folding clothes. Developing
the traits of mindfulness can enhance a person’s ability to observe (or **witness**) thoughts, feelings, and
sensations without acting on them impulsively.

The background is a lighter, out-of-focus natural scene, possibly a landscape with hills. The lighting creates a strong contrast between the dark silhouette and the lighter background.]CHAPTER 6: Evidence-based Practices 281

**Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)⁵⁰**

**Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)** is an evidence-based practice that has been shown to help people with a variety of behavioral health and physical health conditions. ACT rests on the fundamental premise that pain, grief, disappointment, illness, and anxiety are inevitable parts of life. The main goal of ACT is to teach people how to handle these challenges in a healthy way by being more mentally flexible. Instead of trying to push away or ignore these tough feelings and thoughts, ACT encourages embracing them as part of life and moving forward with what’s important to the person, even when it’s hard. This approach can be used for different kinds of issues and is all about focusing on what a person can do about them, rather than what’s going wrong.⁵¹

ACT helps individuals accept what is out of their personal control and commit to action that improves and enriches their life. It utilizes mindfulness strategies alongside behavior change strategies to increase psychological flexibility. Psychological flexibility is the ability to recognize and understand our thoughts and emotions in any given situation, and then continue or change our behavior depending on what we value (or see as a positive outcome in the situation). Psychological flexibility is not escaping or avoiding difficult or painful experiences, but rather being able to be aware of them and work through them so that they no longer control or determine behavior. When used to address problematic substance use, ACT can help people in recovery learn to live with the discomfort of cravings, rather than attempting to eliminate or avoid it. ACT also can help people in recovery learn to live with distressing feelings, memories, and other internal experiences that can trigger cravings.⁵²

To develop psychological flexibility, clients learn six interrelated core processes. Each process builds on the one before it, helping clients navigate triggering situations.

**1. Acceptance:** Learning to accept uncomfortable feelings, urges, and thoughts rather than avoiding or fighting them.

**2. Cognitive Defusion:** Techniques to reduce the impact and influence of negative thoughts and feelings.

**3. Being Present:** Encouraging mindfulness and attention to the present moment without judgment.

**4. Self as Context:** Helping individuals understand the self as a perspective rather than the content of one’s thoughts or the sum of experiences.

**5. Values:** Clarifying what is truly important and meaningful to the individual.

**6. Committed Action:** Taking effective action guided by one’s values despite potential obstacles or discomfort.

ACT has shown great success in the reduction of SUD symptoms by guiding individuals to accept urges and symptoms associated with problematic substance use and using psychological flexibility and value-based interventions to reduce those urges. It can be applied either as monotherapy or in combination with other therapies in the treatment of individuals with SUDs. ACT has proven beneficial in individual wellness and outcomes related to SUD treatment (including from a cost and administration perspective). Research has shown that ACT can result in:⁵³, ⁵⁴

» Relieved anxiety and guilt.
» The ability to experience negative thoughts and feelings without fixating on them or judging them.
» Increased psychological flexibility.
» Improvements in mental health and medical and behavioral health outcomes.
» Improved achievement of long-term goals.282 IC&RC Alcohol and Drug Counselor (ADC) Certification Examination Study Guide

Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy

Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) is a structured therapeutic program designed to prevent the relapse of major depression; it integrates mindfulness practices and principles with cognitive therapy. The primary strategies of MBCT include mindfulness meditation exercises, cognitive-behavioral strategies, and group discussions, with a focus on developing non-judgmental awareness of the present moment.⁵⁵ The intervention is generally delivered in group sessions over eight weeks, including daily homework exercises.

MBCT has shown effectiveness in the following areas.

1.  **Prevention of Depressive Relapse**: MBCT has shown effectiveness in preventing relapse for clients with three or more previous depressive episodes, providing an additive benefit to usual care.⁵⁶
2.  **Reduction of Anxiety and Stress**: Systematic reviews have identified that MBCT can positively affect anxiety, residual depression, mood regulation, and attentional control in individuals with various conditions, including bipolar disorder.⁵⁷
3.  **Improvement in Psychological Well-being**: Studies suggest improvements in mindfulness, personal accomplishment, self-compassion, quality of sleep, and relaxation after participation in MBCT.⁵⁸
4.  **Efficacy in Various Populations**: MBCT is effective in improving many biopsychosocial conditions, including addiction, and is beneficial in healthcare settings, schools, and the workplace. It is considered relatively safe, with ethical aspects warranting consideration.⁵⁹

**EVIDENCE-BASED FAMILY APPROACHES**

Mainstream health care has long acknowledged the benefits of engaging family and social supports to improve treatment adherence and to promote behavioral changes needed to effectively treat many chronic illnesses.⁶⁰ This is also true for people with substance use disorders. Studies of various family therapies have demonstrated positive findings for both adults and adolescents.⁶¹ Here are several evidence-based family therapies that are widely used.

**Family Behavior Therapy (FBT)⁶²**

Family Behavior Therapy (FBT) is a comprehensive intervention strategy that has shown promising results in treating SUDs. FBT not only addresses the substance use issues of the individual but also involves family members in the treatment process. FBT is rooted in behavioral theories. It integrates these principles with family systems theory, which proposes that families operate as interconnected systems, where changes in one part can influence the whole. FBT aims to modify maladaptive behaviors associated with substance use by involving family members in the treatment process, thereby creating a supportive and reinforcing home environment.

FBT strategies are comprised by several key components:

1.  **Behavioral Contracts:** Establishing agreements between the individual with SUD and family members to promote positive behaviors and reduce substance use.
2.  **Skill Training:** Teaching individuals and family members practical skills in communication, problem-solving, and coping strategies to manage stress and avoid relapse.284 IC&RC Alcohol and Drug Counselor (ADC) Certification Examination Study Guide

**3. Contingency Management:** Using reinforcement strategies to encourage abstinence and other positive
behaviors, often through tangible rewards.

**4. Home-Based Reinforcement Strategies:** Implementing changes in the home environment to support
recovery, such as removing substances or substance-related cues and creating a structured routine.

Research on FBT has demonstrated its effectiveness in reducing substance use and improving family functioning.
Studies have shown significant reductions in drug and alcohol use, improvements in mental health symptoms,
and enhanced family relationships. FBT is particularly effective when family members are actively engaged in
the treatment process and when the therapy is tailored to the specific needs and cultural background of the
family.⁶³

**Behavioral Couples Therapy (BCT)**

**Behavioral Couples Therapy (BCT)** addresses the intertwined challenges of SUDs and relationship distress.⁶⁴
BCT facilitates both recovery from substance use and the enhancement of relationship satisfaction by focusing
on the couple as a unit and leveraging the supportive potential of intimate relationships. It is grounded in social
learning theory, which suggests that behavior is learned and maintained through interactions with the social
environment, including significant others. It underscores the role of mutual reinforcement processes, where the
behaviors of each partner affect the other, creating patterns that can either worsen or alleviate substance use.

The intervention strategy of BCT includes several important components:⁶⁵

» **Sobriety Contracts:** Couples establish agreements where the individual with SUD commits to abstinence,
and both partners agree on rewards for maintaining sobriety.

» **Communication Skills Training:** Couples are taught effective communication strategies to improve their
ability to express needs, listen actively, and resolve conflicts without resorting to substance use.

» **Problem-Solving Training:** This component focuses on developing the couple’s ability to collaboratively
address problems, including those related to substance use, in a constructive manner.

» **Relapse Prevention Planning:** Couples work together to identify triggers for substance use, develop
strategies to avoid or cope with these triggers, and plan for how to manage potential relapses.

A large and growing body of evidence supports the effectiveness of Behavioral Couples Therapy. Dozens of
randomized clinical trials have found evidence for Behavioral Couples Therapy being more effective than both
the placebo or no treatment at all.⁶⁶ Research also has shown Behavioral Couples Therapy to increase abstinence
rates and improve relationship functioning better than classic individual-based treatment, while also reducing
social costs, domestic violence, and emotional problems in children of the couple.⁶⁷

**Family Therapies for Treating SUDs in Adolescents**

The prevailing and extensively researched evidence-based programs that focus on families that have adolescents
in treatment are:

» **Multi-Systemic Therapy (MST).** MST is an evidence-based treatment originally developed for youth
with serious antisocial behavior who are at high risk for out-of-home placement and their families;
and subsequently adapted to address other challenging clinical problems experience by youths and their
families. The therapy focuses on the multiple aspects of a young person’s social network, including
their family, peers, school, and neighborhood, to address the complex needs that contribute to antisocial
behaviors. MST is one of the most extensively evaluated family-based treatments. Outcome research
has yielded almost uniformly favorable results for youth and families, and implementation research has
demonstrated the importance of treatment and program fidelity in achieving such outcomes.⁶⁸CHAPTER 6: Evidence-based Practices 285

» **Multi-Dimensional Family Therapy (MDFT).** MDFT is a comprehensive and multisystemic family-based
outpatient or partial hospitalization program for adolescents with problematic substance use and those
at risk for continued substance abuse and other behavioral problems. It integrates individual, family, and
environmental interventions to optimize growth and development for the adolescent and family. The
therapy is structured around four primary domains: adolescent and parent(s) individually, the parent–
adolescent relationship, and interaction with family and social systems, demonstrating effectiveness
in reducing substance use and improving family functioning among adolescents with SUDs and related
disorders.⁶⁹

» **Brief Strategic Family Therapy (BSFT).** BSFT is designed to treat children and adolescents with behavior
problems, including conduct disorders, oppositional behavior, delinquency, and problematic substance
use. It aims to improve family interactions believed to be contributing to the child’s behavior problems,
focusing on improving family communication, problem-solving, conflict resolution, and effective
parenting skills. BSFT has been shown to be effective in reducing substance use and other problematic
behaviors in adolescents, improving family functioning, and increasing treatment engagement and
retention compared to traditional services.⁷⁰

» **Functional Family Therapy (FFT).** FFT is a short-term intervention program for young people with
behavioral problems, delinquency, and problematic substance use. The therapy focuses on enhancing
family communication, supportiveness, and problem-solving skills while decreasing negativity and
dysfunctional patterns of behavior. FFT is structured in phases that include engagement, motivation,
assessment, behavior change, and generalization, with each phase designed to build on the strengths
within the family and the individual to achieve improved behavior and relationships. FFT has been found
effective in reducing recidivism, improving family functioning, and decreasing problem behaviors in
adolescents.⁷¹

**EVIDENCE-BASED TRAUMA APPROACHES**

As discussed in Chapter 2, SUDs and trauma are chronic, debilitating conditions that frequently co-occur. Individuals with a history of problematic substance use may also have a history of trauma, even though they may not be able to recall aspects of their trauma. These individuals have a more complicated course of treatment and less favorable treatment outcomes compared to individuals with either disorder alone. Failing to address trauma in people who have problematic substance use can lead to worse outcomes.72

SUD counselors should be able to recognize the effects of trauma on the lives of people in recovery and use trauma-sensitive or trauma-responsive services. Those who have survived trauma will vary in how they experience it. A client may have emotional reactions (e.g., anxiety, guilt, sadness, depression); physical reactions (e.g., sweating, nausea, fatigue, sleep disturbances); and cognitive reactions (e.g., difficulty concentrating, memory problems, self-blame); among many others. Becoming trauma aware and informed is a first step in this process.73

SUD counselors can best serve clients who have experienced trauma by providing integrated treatment that combines therapeutic models to target presenting symptoms and disorders. Treatment may include the use of effective pharmacotherapies (medications). Having a comprehensive approach acknowledges that the disorders interact with each other, requiring tailored interventions. Some trauma treatment models have integrated curricula; others that address trauma alone can be combined with counseling techniques with which the counselor is already familiar. For example, Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) plays a fundamental role in treating trauma. The same strategies that focus on identifying and challenging dysfunctional thoughts, beliefs, and attitudes are also applied to traumatic experiences.

Key components of CBT for trauma include:74

1.  **Psychoeducation**: Educating clients about trauma and its effects helps normalize their experiences and sets the stage for treatment.
2.  **Cognitive Processing**: Clients are guided to identify and evaluate their trauma-related thoughts and beliefs, particularly those that are distorted or unhelpful, such as feelings of guilt or blame.
3.  **Exposure Therapy**: A critical element in trauma-focused CBT, where clients are gradually and systematically exposed to thoughts, feelings, and situations related to their trauma in a controlled way, to diminish their emotional response and avoidance behaviors.
4.  **Stress Management**: Teaching coping skills, such as relaxation techniques, mindfulness, and problem-solving, helps clients manage the anxiety and stress associated with their traumatic memories.
5.  **Emotional Regulation**: Clients learn strategies to manage intense emotions related to trauma, improving their ability to cope with distressing situations.
6.  **Relapse Prevention**: Developing long-term strategies to maintain gains and handle potential stressors or trauma reminders in the future.

CBT for trauma is often time-limited and goal-oriented, with a strong emphasis on practicing skills outside of counseling sessions to enhance resilience and coping. Counselors should be adept at tailoring these interventions to the individual’s specific traumatic experiences and needs, fostering a supportive therapeutic environment where clients feel safe to explore and process their trauma.

Here are several widely used evidence-based treatments for trauma. **Appendix G** contains a more complete list of prevailing evidence-based trauma treatments.CHAPTER 6: Evidence-based Practices 287

**Cognitive Processing Therapy**75

**Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT)** is a specific type of cognitive-behavioral therapy that has been extensively researched and is highly effective for treating post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and related conditions. It is designed to help individuals understand and change how they think about their trauma and its aftermath. The goal of CPT is to help clients learn how to challenge and modify unhelpful beliefs related to the trauma, reduce ongoing distress, and improve daily functioning. The key components are:

1.  **Structured Approach:** CPT is typically delivered over 12 to 16 sessions, each lasting about 60 minutes. The therapy can be administered in individual or group settings.
2.  **Focus on Stuck Points:** The therapy identifies “stuck points,” which are unhelpful or distorted thoughts that prevent individuals from recovering from their trauma. These stuck points often pertain to themes of safety, trust, power/control, esteem, and intimacy.
3.  **Writing and Talking About the Trauma:** Clients are often asked to write detailed accounts of their traumatic experiences, which are then used in the therapy sessions to identify and challenge stuck points.
4.  **Cognitive Restructuring:** Central to CPT is the practice of challenging and modifying unhelpful beliefs and thoughts.
5.  **Homework Assignments:** Between sessions, clients complete homework assignments to practice the skills learned in therapy, reinforcing the cognitive restructuring process.

Numerous studies have shown that CPT significantly reduces the symptoms of PTSD, depression, and anxiety. For example, a meta-analysis found that CPT was effective in reducing and maintaining PTSD symptoms across various populations, including military veterans and survivors of sexual assault.76, 77

**Prolonged Exposure Therapy (PE)**

**Prolonged Exposure Therapy (PE)** is also grounded in cognitive-behavioral principles and is designed to treat post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and related conditions. The core theory behind PE is that exposure to thoughts, feelings, and situations related to trauma in a controlled and therapeutic manner can help reduce the power these experiences have over an individual. The therapy is based on the idea that repeated exposure to trauma-related stimuli reduces the psychological distress associated with these stimuli over time, through a process called habituation. The key components are:

1.  **Psychoeducation:** Clients are educated about common reactions to trauma and the specific treatment approach of PE, establishing a rationale for the treatment.
2.  **Breathing Retraining:** Clients are taught breathing techniques to help manage immediate feelings of anxiety and stress.

3.  **In Vivo Exposure:** This involves real-life confrontation with situations, places, and objects that the person has been avoiding because they are reminders of the trauma. The goal is to reduce fear and avoidance behavior.

4.  **Imaginal Exposure:** Clients are asked to repeatedly recount the traumatic event aloud during therapy sessions to reduce the emotional impact of memories and to facilitate processing of the trauma.

5.  **Processing:** After imaginal exposure, the therapist and client discuss the thoughts and feelings that arose during the recounting, with the aim of altering any maladaptive beliefs and enhancing understanding of the event.

**Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy**<sup>78</sup>

**Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT)** is a structured, evidence-based treatment designed to help children, adolescents, and their caregivers overcome the emotional and psychological effects of trauma. It is particularly effective for those who have experienced traumatic events, such as physical or sexual abuse, natural disasters, accidents, or the loss of a loved one. TF-CBT is grounded in CBT principles. The treatment typically lasts between 12 to 16 sessions, though the duration can vary based on the individual's needs. The therapy can be delivered in individual, group, or family settings and is suitable for children and adolescents aged 3 to 18 years.

The therapy process of TF-CBT is structured around several core components, often remembered by the acronym PRACTICE:

» **Psychoeducation:** Educating the child and caregivers about the impact of trauma on thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and teaching about the therapy process.

» **Relaxation:** Teaching the child and caregivers stress management and relaxation techniques to cope with trauma-related anxiety and stress.

» **Affective Expression and Regulation:** Helping the child identify and manage a range of emotions and teaching them how to express feelings in a healthy way.

» **Cognitive Coping:** Assisting the child in identifying and challenging distorted or unhelpful thoughts related to the trauma and developing a more realistic and positive way of thinking.

» **Trauma Narrative and Processing:** Guiding the child in creating a detailed narrative of their traumatic experience(s) and helping them process the thoughts and feelings associated with the trauma.

» **In Vivo Gradual Exposure:** Gradually exposing the child to trauma reminders in a controlled and safe manner to reduce fear and avoidance behaviors.

» **Conjoint Child-Parent Sessions:** Facilitating sessions where the child and caregivers come together to discuss the trauma narrative and improve communication.

» **Enhancing Safety and Future Development:** Teaching the child and caregivers strategies for safety planning and skills for handling future stressors or potential traumas.

TF-CBT is evidence-based and has been validated in numerous studies, showing significant improvements in trauma-related symptoms, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, and behavioral problems. It also aims to improve the parent-child relationship and support the family's overall healing and resilience.<sup>79</sup>[Layout: The page has a header at the top.

CHAPTER 6: Evidence-based Practices
289

EMDR Therapy (EMDR)⁸⁰

**Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR)** is a trauma-focused psychotherapy that is one of the most studied treatments for PTSD. Many studies demonstrate it is effective to treat PTSD when administered over approximately 3 months. EMDR has the strongest recommendation for being an effective treatment in most clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of PTSD.

EMDR therapy emphasizes that the mind can heal from psychological trauma much as the body recovers from physical trauma. When a traumatic event occurs, the overwhelming emotions can interrupt the normal processing of the memory, causing it to be frozen in time. EMDR therapy helps by removing the block, allowing the brain to resume its natural healing process. Counselors using EMDR need to be well-trained in the technique, ensuring they can provide a structured and supportive environment for clients to process their traumatic memories effectively.

The key components of EMDR include:

1.  **Phases of Treatment:** EMDR is structured into eight distinct phases, including history taking, preparation, assessment, desensitization, installation, body scan, closure, and reevaluation, which collectively aim to process traumatic memories fully.
2.  **Bilateral Stimulation:** A core feature of EMDR is the use of bilateral sensory input, such as side-to-side eye movements, tactile taps, or auditory tones, which is believed to facilitate the brain's information processing system.
3.  **Targeting Traumatic Memories:** EMDR focuses directly on traumatic memory and is intended to change the way the memory is stored in the brain, reducing its lingering effects, and allowing for more adaptive coping mechanisms.
4.  **Desensitization:** This phase involves the client focusing on a traumatic memory while simultaneously engaging in bilateral stimulation, with the goal of reducing the emotional charge associated with the memory.
5.  **Installation:** The positive beliefs and cognitions about oneself are strengthened to replace the negative beliefs related to the trauma.
6.  **Body Scan:** Clients are asked to observe their physical response while thinking about the incident and the positive belief, aiming to identify and resolve any remaining somatic distress.
7.  **Safety and Stability:** EMDR emphasizes creating a safe environment and ensuring the client has adequate coping mechanisms to handle emotional distress, both within and outside of therapy sessions.

**MUTUAL SUPPORT APPROACH**

**12-Step Facilitation (TSF)**

**Twelve-Step Facilitation (TSF)** is a structured, evidence-based program designed to encourage individuals with SUDs to engage in a community-based recovery process, such as those offered by Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) or Narcotics Anonymous (NA). The program is grounded in the philosophy of the 12 steps, which are a set of guiding principles outlining a course of action for recovery from addiction, compulsion, or other behavioral problems.

The TSF manual originated from Project MATCH, one of the largest addiction clinical trials, evaluating Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET), and Twelve-Step Facilitation (TSF). The study aimed to determine if individuals with alcohol use disorders benefited more from specific treatments based on their characteristics. Results showed TSF was as effective as CBT and MET. The original TSF manual was developed to provide a structured approach for counselors to help clients engage with 12-step programs and integrate its principles into their lives.⁸²

**Key Components of TSF:⁸³**

» **Acceptance and Surrender:** TSF emphasizes the acceptance of addiction as a chronic, progressive disease that requires lifelong abstinence and surrender to a higher power or greater reality beyond oneself.

» **Active Participation:** Individuals are encouraged to actively participate in 12-step meetings, share personal experiences, and engage with the community, fostering a sense of belonging and mutual support.

» **Working the Steps:** The program guides individuals through the 12 steps, which include admitting powerlessness over problematic substance use, acknowledging the need for help, making amends for past harms, and helping others with similar problems.

» **Sponsorship:** Participants are encouraged to work with a sponsor, an experienced member of the 12-step program who provides guidance, support, and mentorship through the recovery process.

» **Spiritual Growth:** While not religious, TSF has a spiritual component, urging individuals to explore their spirituality and develop a personal relationship with a higher power of their understanding.

The objectives of TSF are to promote abstinence from substances through a structured, supportive community framework, to help individuals recognize and accept their problematic substance use, to integrate individuals into the 12-step recovery community, and to facilitate ongoing support and personal growth and healing. TSF has five core sessions that introduce and integrate individuals into the 12-step recovery process, focusing on key principles and actions that support the objectives.

TSF is adaptable to various settings, including outpatient and residential treatment programs, and can be integrated with other therapeutic approaches to provide comprehensive care for individuals with SUD. Its effectiveness has been supported by research, showing improvements in abstinence rates, engagement in recovery activities, and overall well-being.⁸⁴, ⁸⁵, ⁸⁶[Layout: The page has a header at the top with a chapter title on the left and a page number on the right.

CHAPTER 6: Evidence-based Practices 291

**MEDICATION-ASSISTED TREATMENTS**

Since the 1990s, dramatic increases in controlled medication prescriptions—particularly opioid pain relievers—
have coincided with increases in their misuse. Since the mid-2000s, heroin and fentanyl (mainly illicit
formulations) consumption has also sharply increased. Over the past five years, there has been a concerning rise
in opioid use, largely attributed to factors such as increased prescription of painkillers, the increased availability
of synthetic opioids like fentanyl, and economic and social stressors. This surge has been marked by a higher
prevalence of problematic use of prescription opioids and a significant uptick in the use of illicit opioids, leading
to a devastating impact on public health, including a spike in overdose deaths. The accessibility and potency of
these substances have prompted actions for enhanced prevention, treatment, and policy measures to address the
opioid crisis effectively.⁸⁷

In response to this crisis, there has been a notable rise in the use of Medication-Assisted Treatments (MAT),
which combine FDA-approved medications with counseling and behavioral therapies to effectively treat
substance use disorders. This approach helps moderate the problematic use of opioids and alcohol by providing
more comprehensive and sustainable treatment options, aiming to reduce withdrawal symptoms and cravings,
and prevent the escalation to more dangerous substances like heroin and fentanyl.

In addition to the opioid crisis, the prevalence of alcohol use disorders (AUD) remains a significant public health
challenge, with a notable impact on individuals, families, and society at large. Almost one-third of the U.S.
population meets AUD criteria on a lifetime basis.⁸⁸ According to the 2022 National Survey on Drug Use and
Health (NSDUH), 29.5 million people ages 12 and older (10.5% in this age group) had AUD in the past year.⁸⁹ Of
these, 753,000 are youth ages 12 to 17. The same study showed that only 2.2 million people ages 12 and older with
AUD received treatment, representing 7.6% of those with past-year AUD in this age group. Furthermore, many
more individuals engage in risky drinking or experience alcohol-related negative consequences who fall short of
meeting clinical diagnostic criteria for AUD. These alarming statistics highlight the importance of MAT services
for problematic alcohol use.

MAT is an evidence-based treatment for alcohol use disorders and opioid use disorders. MAT uses medications,
in combination with counseling and other therapeutic techniques, to provide a “whole-person” approach to the
treatment of SUDs. Its effectiveness is well-documented in numerous studies and publications, underscoring
its role in improving client outcomes and supporting long-term recovery.⁹⁰ The Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) has approved several different medications to treat alcohol use disorders (AUD) and opioid use disorders
(OUD). These medications relieve the withdrawal symptoms and psychological cravings that cause chemical
imbalances in the body. Medications used are evidence-based treatment options and do not just substitute one
drug for another.

According to SAMHSA, while MAT’s goal is full recovery, it has been shown to improve client survival, increase
retention in treatment, decrease illicit opiate use and other criminal activity among people with SUDs, increase
clients’ ability to gain and maintain employment, and improve birth outcomes among women who have SUDs
and are pregnant. The length of treatment is different for everyone, but research shows that the longer clients
are on MAT, the better their rates of long-term success. Some clients may be on MAT for the rest of their lives.
There is no right or wrong length of time – it all depends on the client’s needs. Research shows that clients
should receive medication for as long as it provides a benefit.⁹¹292 IC&RC Alcohol and Drug Counselor (ADC) Certification Examination Study Guide

**Medications for Alcohol Use Disorder⁹²**

A SAMHSA/National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) national consensus panel recommends pharmacotherapy along with behavioral interventions for AUD. Yet, in 2022, only 2.1% of clients with AUD were treated with medications in the past year.⁹³ This is of serious concern because of the high prevalence of alcohol use and related issues in the general population. It is important to emphasize, however, that the involvement of physicians and other health/behavioral health care professionals in identifying and treating AUD is possible, practical, and necessary. The medications described in this section have been shown to be effective for the management of AUDs or the prevention of a recurrence to alcohol use.

Acamprosate, disulfiram, and naltrexone are the most common drugs used to treat AUD.

» **Acamprosate** (Campral) was approved by the FDA in 2004 with demonstrated primary effectiveness for maintaining abstinence from alcohol. The target population for this medication would include people who want continued sobriety after a period of abstinence and who do not have severe kidney problems. It works to prevent people from drinking alcohol, but it does not prevent withdrawal symptoms after people drink alcohol. The use of acamprosate typically begins on the fifth day of abstinence, reaching full effectiveness in five to eight days. It is taken in tablet form three times a day.

Acamprosate is well tolerated, with generally mild side effects. Its use is not affected by liver function, making it suitable for people with liver disease, a common comorbidity in alcohol-dependent individuals. The most frequently reported side effects of Acamprosate include gastrointestinal disturbances such as diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. Some people may also experience itching, rash, dizziness, and fatigue.

» **Disulfiram** (Antabuse) was approved by the FDA approved in 1949 and has modest effectiveness in preventing recurrence in problematic alcohol use, particularly when medication adherence is supervised. This medication treats chronic AUDs and is most effective in people who have already stopped drinking alcohol or are in the initial stage of abstinence. Taken in a tablet form once a day, disulfiram should never be taken while intoxicated and it should not be taken for at least 12 hours after drinking alcohol.

Disulfiram does not reduce the craving for alcohol, but it causes unpleasant symptoms when alcohol is ingested because it inhibits aldehyde dehydrogenase and alcohol metabolism. These side effects (nausea, headache, vomiting, chest pains, difficulty breathing) can occur as soon as ten minutes after drinking even a small amount of alcohol. The side effects provide negative reinforcement which in turn promotes alcohol avoidance in AUD.

» **Naltrexone** (ReVia and Vivitrol) is used in the treatment of both alcohol and opioid use disorders due to its ability to block the euphoric effects of these substances. The FDA approved oral naltrexone for the treatment of alcohol dependence or alcoholism in 1994. The low rate of retention and adherence encountered with oral naltrexone led to the development of the extended-release injectable formulation, which the FDA approved for the treatment of alcohol use disorder in 2006.⁹⁴ Brand names are:

  › **ReVia**: One of the earliest brand names for naltrexone, primarily used for treating alcohol dependence.
  › **Vivitrol**: A long-acting, injectable form of naltrexone

Naltrexone lessens the rewarding effects of alcohol consumption by blocking the opioid receptors in the brain, which are involved in the pleasure and reward pathways. This reduction in the rewarding effects of alcohol can decrease the urge to drink and help maintain abstinence. Both daily naltrexone and long-acting injectable naltrexone have strong evidence for their use as they have been shown to improve numerous drinking outcomes, including a return to any drinking and a return to heavy drinking.⁹⁵

Naltrexone generally is well tolerated, although it has the potential to precipitate severe opioid withdrawal in patients who are opioid dependent. Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, headaches, dizziness, fatigue, anxiety, and somnolence, with nausea and vomiting the most frequently reported.[Layout: Single column with a header. An image is present at the bottom of the page.]

CHAPTER 6: Evidence-based Practices 293

**Medications for Opioid Use Disorder**⁹⁶

Three medications have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of opioid use disorders (OUD): methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone. These medications are effective for treating people with OUDs, as well as legally prescribed opioid pain relievers that are misused, such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, and morphine. The medications work by easing withdrawal symptoms from opioids and blocking their euphoric effects.

Each drug affects the brain in different ways. Knowing the pharmacological action of these medications helps counselors understand how these drugs will affect the client’s brain chemistry and behavior.

» **An agonist** is a drug that activates certain receptors in the brain. Full agonist opioids activate the opioid receptors in the brain fully resulting in the full opioid effect. Examples of full agonists are heroin, oxycodone, methadone, hydrocodone, morphine, opium, and others.

» **A partial agonist** drug activates the opioid receptors in the brain, but to a much lesser degree than a full agonist. Buprenorphine is an example of a partial agonist.

» **An antagonist** is a drug that blocks opioids by attaching to the opioid receptors without activating them. Antagonists cause no opioid effect and block full agonist opioids. Examples are naltrexone and naloxone.

MAT services for OUD are provided by **opioid treatment providers** (OTPs) of MAT are certified by the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and accredited by an independent, SAMHSA-approved accrediting body. Additionally, OTPs must be state-licensed and registered with the federal Drug Enforcement Administration.⁹⁷ Under federal regulations for methadone treatment, the medication must typically be administered daily in a certified opioid treatment program (OTP) unless a patient meets program-specific criteria for take-home doses. In accordance with federal law, buprenorphine may be prescribed by office-based clinicians, but they must first complete additional training and apply for a waiver. Naltrexone can also be prescribed by office-based clinicians, though without the need for additional approvals.

Currently, no empirical data indicates which clients will respond better to which OUD medications. All clients considering treatment should be educated about the effectiveness, risks, and benefits of each of the three OUD medications, treatment without medication, and no treatment. OUD medications are safe and effective when used appropriately, and clients reduce or stop illicit opioid use and improve their health and functioning.⁹⁸

**METHADONE**

Methadone is a long-acting synthetic opioid agonist. Methadone is the most used and most studied OUD medication in the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) considers it an essential medication. Many clinical trials and meta-analyses have shown that it effectively reduces illicit opioid use, treats OUD, and retains clients in treatment better than a placebo or no medication. Methadone works by binding to and activating the same opioid receptors in the brain as other opioids like heroin, morphine, and oxycodone. However, it does so more slowly and without producing the same intense high, which helps reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms. Advantages of methadone is that treatment can begin right away without detoxification and dosing is once daily in most cases.

Methadone's primary use in MAT is to alleviate withdrawal symptoms and reduce cravings in individuals addicted to opioids, thereby facilitating a more stable and controlled recovery process. It is available primarily in the following forms:

*   » **Oral Solution**: The most common form used in MAT programs, where the liquid is swallowed.
*   » **Tablet**: Can be swallowed or sometimes dissolved in water to drink.
*   » **Dispensable Powder**: Mixed with water for oral administration.
*   » **Injectable Form**: Administered by healthcare professionals in certain clinical settings, though less common for MAT.

The administration of methadone for OUD treatment is typically carried out in a controlled clinical setting:

*   » **Controlled Environment**: Due to its potential for abuse and overdose, methadone is usually administered in a clinic where the client consumes the dose under the supervision of healthcare professionals.
*   » **Daily Dosing**: Methadone is often taken daily, especially in the initial phases of treatment, to maintain a stable level of the drug in the bloodstream and manage withdrawal symptoms and cravings.
*   » **Induction Phase**: Starting methadone treatment involves a careful titration process to find the appropriate dose that effectively mitigates withdrawal symptoms without causing sedation or respiratory depression.
*   » **Maintenance and Tapering**: Once a stable dose is reached, the client continues on maintenance therapy, which can last for several months to years. If discontinuation is planned, the dose is gradually tapered down to prevent withdrawal symptoms.

Methadone carries a risk of overdose, especially during the induction phase or if taken inappropriately. Its long half-life can lead to accumulation in the body if doses are taken too frequently. In the United States, methadone for OUD treatment can only be dispensed through a certified opioid treatment program (OTP) regulated by SAMHSA and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).

**NALTREXONE**

As previously discussed, Naltrexone is used in the treatment of both alcohol and opioid use disorders. It was initially developed to treat addiction to opioids and was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of OUDs 1984. In 2010, the FDA approved a monthly injectable extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX). Brand names are:

*   » **ReVia**: One of the earliest brand names for naltrexone, primarily used for treating alcohol dependence.
*   » **Vivitrol**: A long-acting, injectable form of naltrexone

Unlike methadone and buprenorphine, naltrexone is an opioid antagonist, which means it works by blocking opioid receptors and preventing their euphoric effects. Before initiating either formulation of naltrexone, patients must be opioid abstinent. Naltrexone should only be used seven to ten days after medically managed withdrawal (detoxification) from opioids has been completed. Medically supervised opioid withdrawal can be conducted on an outpatient or inpatient basis. The latter is often reserved for patients with co-occurring SUDs, MHDs or medical illness.

Naltrexone can be prescribed by any healthcare provider licensed to prescribe medications. It does not require special training like buprenorphine and methadone. Naltrexone can be delivered as a daily oral dose or as a long-acting injection. The long-acting injection only needs to be administered once per month, which has shown an increase in adherence and retention rates.⁹⁹[Layout: Single column main text with a text box inset on the right side. A header is present at the top of the page.]

CHAPTER 6: Evidence-based Practices 295

**BUPRENORPHINE**

Buprenorphine is a partial opioid agonist. It produces effects such as
euphoria or respiratory depression at a lower potential than full agonists
like heroin or methadone. Its unique pharmacological properties make it
an essential component MAT, helping individuals reduce or quit their use
of opioids. Buprenorphine binds to the brain’s opioid receptors, partially
stimulating them to alleviate withdrawal symptoms and cravings without
producing the full opioid effect. This action reduces the risk of misuse,
dependency, and side effects. Additionally, buprenorphine has a “ceiling
effect,” meaning that its effects plateau at a certain dose, decreasing the
risk of overdose.

Buprenorphine is available in several formulations, each designed to meet
various treatment needs and client preferences:

**1. Sublingual Tablets and Films:** The most common forms are
sublingual (under the tongue) tablets and films that dissolve
in the mouth. These forms allow for rapid absorption into the
bloodstream. Clients must avoid eating, drinking, or smoking
prior to and during the administration to ensure optimal
absorption.

**2. Buccal Films:** Like sublingual forms, buccal films are applied to
the inside of the cheek (buccal mucosa), where the medication is
absorbed.

**3. Long-Acting Injectable:** Buprenorphine is also available in a
long-acting injectable form, administered monthly by a healthcare professional. This option can improve
compliance by eliminating the need for daily dosing.

**4. Implantable Devices:** Buprenorphine can be administered through a small implant placed under the
skin, which releases the medication over a period of several months. This form is less common and
used for clients who require long-term, steady dosing and has demonstrated stability on transmucosal
buprenorphine.

[Text box on the right side]
**The following buprenorphine
products are FDA approved for
the treatment of OUD:**
*   Generic Buprenorphine/naloxone
    sublingual tablets
*   Buprenorphine sublingual tablets
    (Subutex)
*   Buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual
    films (Suboxone)
*   Buprenorphine/naloxone)
    sublingual tablets (Zubsolv)
*   Buprenorphine/naloxone buccal
    film (Bunavail)
*   Buprenorphine implants
    (Probuphine)
*   Buprenorphine extended-release
    injection (Sublocade)
[End of text box]

Buprenorphine is available outside of OTPs, through non-OTP healthcare settings (e.g., physicians’ offices,
outpatient drug treatment programs). Section 1262 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 removes the
federal requirement for practitioners to have an “X” waiver to prescribe buprenorphine. All practitioners who
have a current DEA registration that includes Schedule III authority, may now prescribe buprenorphine for OUD
in their practice if permitted by applicable state law.

Buprenorphine is marketed under several brand names (as indicated in the text box), each tailored for different
uses, including the treatment of pain and opioid use disorder.¹⁰⁰296 IC&RC Alcohol and Drug Counselor (ADC) Certification Examination Study Guide

**MEDICATION** | **HOW IT'S TAKEN** | **WHY IT WORKS** | **SIDE EFFECTS** | **CONSIDERATIONS**
---|---|---|---|---
**Buprenorphine** | Tablet dissolved under the tongue or film dissolved under the tongue or against the inside of the cheek. Taken once daily, every other day, or 3 times a week. It also comes as an implant that lasts 6 months or as an injection that lasts 1 month. | Partially activates the opioid receptor. Reduces craving and blocks the euphoric effect of opioids. | Can cause constipation, headache, nausea, insomnia, excessive sweating, or opioid withdrawal. Overdose is possible but less likely than with methadone. Overdose death risk increases if buprenorphine is taken with alcohol or intravenously in combination with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants. Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) | Less sedating than methadone. Prescribers måust have a special SAMHSA waiver but don’t need to be part of a federally certified OTP. Can be prescribed through pharmacies or provided via OTPs.

The implant and injection can only be prescribed by waivered providers who have completed REMS training.
**Methadone** | Liquid or tablet once daily. Dose may be divided for twice-daily dosing if medically necessary. | Fully activates the opioid receptor. Reduces craving and blocks the euphoric effect of opioids. | Can cause constipation, sleepiness, sweating, swelling of hands and feet, sexual dysfunction, heart arrhythmias, low blood pressure, fainting, and substance misuse.

Can cause overdose •. • death if increased too rapidly, taken in a much higher than usual dose, or taken concurrently with some substances and medications, particularly CNS depressants such as alcohol or benzodiazepines. Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) | Initially requires visits 6 to 7 times per week to an OTP. Patients can decrease attendance gradually based on time in treatment and clinical stability.
**Naltrexone** | Daily tablet (can also be taken 3 times a week) or monthly injection in buttock. | Occupies the opioid receptors. Reduces craving and blocks the euphoric effect of opioids. | Can cause nausea, headache, dizziness, fatigue, liver toxicity, depression and suicidality, muscle cramps, fainting, and loss of or decreased appetite or other appetite disorders; in the extended-release injectable formulation, can cause pain, swelling, and other complications at the injection site.

Client must complete withdrawal and stay opioid abstinent for at least 7 days before starting naltrexone and longer (e.g., 10 or more days) for long-acting opioids, such as methadone. | Tablets are rarely effective.

Monthly injections are more effective than tablets.[Layout: The page has a header, a main single column of text, and a sidebar on the right.]

CHAPTER 6: Evidence-based Practices

**Use of MAT During Pregnancy**¹⁰¹, ¹⁰²

Substance use while pregnant, especially opioid use, has escalated dramatically in recent years, mirroring the
epidemic observed in the general public. Pregnancy provides an important opportunity to identify and treat
women with SUDs. Pregnant women who undergo early universal screening and referral to treatment and
supportive services show improved maternal and infant outcomes. The types of agencies and professionals
providing treatment and other services to pregnant women with OUDs can vary widely from one community to
another. Every professional involved needs to understand a pregnant woman’s distinct needs, and those of her
family members, before implementing the most appropriate and comprehensive plan of care.

Pregnant women who are physically dependent on opioids should
receive MAT from a physician rather than withdrawal management
or abstinence, since those approaches may pose a risk to the pregnant
woman and the fetus. According to the American College of Obstetricians
and Gynecologists (ACOG), the current standard of care for pregnant
women with OUDs is referral for MAT with methadone and/or
buprenorphine since “abrupt discontinuation of opioids in an opioid-
dependent pregnant woman can result in preterm labor, fetal distress, or
fetal demise.”¹⁰³

Since the 1970s, opioid agonist pharmacotherapy with methadone in
combination with counseling and behavioral therapy has been the
standard treatment of heroin addiction during pregnancy.¹⁰⁴ In later
years, methadone and buprenorphine are first-line therapy options for
pregnant people with OUD, recommended by both the ACOG and SAMHSA,
in conjunction with behavioral therapy and medical services. While
some treatment centers use naltrexone to treat OUD in pregnant women,
current information on its safety during pregnancy is limited. ACOG
recommends that if a woman is stable on naltrexone prior to pregnancy,
the decision regarding whether to continue naltrexone treatment during
pregnancy should involve a careful discussion between the provider
and the client, weighing the limited safety data on naltrexone with the
potential risk of relapse with discontinuation of treatment.¹⁰⁵

It is important to recognize that **Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome (NOWS)** is an expected condition that
can follow exposure to MAT for an OUD. A concern for NOWS alone should not deter healthcare providers from
prescribing medication. Close collaboration with the pediatric care team can help ensure that infants born to
people who used opioids during pregnancy are monitored for NOWS and receive appropriate treatment, as well as
be referred to needed services.¹⁰⁶

For pregnant women diagnosed with an OUD, there is a chance that their infant may experience withdrawal
symptoms after birth. Like any medication given during pregnancy, MAT has both risks and benefits to the
mother and fetus. Therefore, MAT needs careful consideration and coordination from all treatment and medical
professionals involved.

» NOWS represents the pattern of effects linked to withdrawal for newborns with prenatal exposure to
certain substances, including opioids. Many factors influence NOWS symptoms, including the type of
opioid involved, the point in gestation when the mother used the opioid, genetic factors, and exposure to
multiple substances including tobacco.¹⁰⁷

» NOWS is a treatable condition. According to ACOG, “All infants born to women who use opioids during
pregnancy should be monitored for neonatal abstinence syndrome and treated if indicated. There are no
known risks of increased birth defects with pharmacotherapy medications.”¹⁰⁸

Medications for alcohol use disorder (AUD) should be approached with caution in pregnant women due to potential risks to the fetus. The decision to use these medications must be carefully weighed against the risks of continued alcohol use. Here's a summary of considerations for some commonly used AUD medications:

» **Naltrexone:** Not typically recommended during pregnancy due to limited data on its safety. Animal studies have shown adverse effects, but there is insufficient human data.
» **Acamprosate:** Also has limited data on its use during pregnancy, and it's not well studied. It should only be used if the potential benefits justify the potential risks to the fetus.
» **Disulfiram:** Generally, not recommended during pregnancy due to potential risks and limited data on its safety in pregnant women.

The management of AUD in pregnant women often focuses more on counseling, support programs, and other non-pharmacological interventions. Any medication use during pregnancy should be a decision made in collaboration with a healthcare provider, considering the specific circumstances and potential risks and benefits. It is crucial for pregnant women with AUD to seek medical advice and receive close monitoring throughout their pregnancy.

**The Counselor's Role in MAT¹⁰⁹**

SUD counselors can play an integral role in supporting MAT. Counseling combined with medication can be effective for addressing problematic substance use. In fact, medication may be the most effective treatment and standard of care for people with OUD. In some cases, clients who take medication for SUD (e.g., methadone) are required to receive counseling along with their prescription. As SAMHSA notes, **medication is more effective when counseling and other behavioral health therapies are included to provide clients with a whole-person approach.** While counseling combined with medication can be effective, some clients may not receive or decide[Layout: The page has a header, a main text body, and a text box on the right side. The main text body has several bullet points and a section heading. There are small superscript numbers (citations) throughout the text.]

CHAPTER 6: Evidence-based Practices 299

not to engage in counseling. Counseling should not be a requirement to receive medications to support recovery.

SUD counselors can start by addressing the stigmatization and misunderstanding of MAT, which is often perceived as secondary to psychosocial interventions or just a continuance of “addiction” with another drug. SUD counselors must possess a thorough understanding of MAT actions, risks, and uses to advocate effectively for its inclusion in treatment plans. They have a responsibility to educate clients about the benefits and limitations of MAT, addressing misconceptions, and providing a supportive environment conducive to recovery. Here a few additional examples of how SUD counselors can support MAT:

» They can provide crucial education to clients and their family members on the various types and
effectiveness of MAT, to demystify its use and foster acceptance of these as a viable method for treating a
chronic OUD/AUD.

» They can help clients overcome challenges they face in obtaining MAT, such as troubleshooting issues
related to the client’s ability to pay for OUD/AUD medication or facilitating subsidized transportation to
get to prescriber appointments.

» They can help women who have OUD/AUD prepare for a safe and healthy pregnancy by offering
information about how OUD/AUD can affect the baby, options for effective OUD/AUD treatment, and other
steps they can take to support a healthy pregnancy. They can educate women and their family members
on:
    › The benefits and risks of continuing MAT for an OUD/AUD during pregnancy.
    › The need for ongoing prenatal care.
    › The potential for the baby to develop NOWS, including how this condition can be treated and
      managed.
    › Available recovery supports, including counseling and other services that may be helpful to address
      any housing- or food-related needs.110

Overall, SUD counselors are integral to the successful implementation of medication-assisted treatments,
offering a holistic approach that supports medications with counseling and psychosocial support to address the
unique needs of each client.

**OPIOID OVERDOSE PREVENTION - NALOXONE**111, 112

**Naloxone** is a medication approved by the FDA designed to rapidly
reverse opioid overdose. It is an opioid receptor antagonist—meaning
that it binds to opioid receptors and can reverse and block the effects
of other opioids, such as heroin, morphine, and oxycodone. Giving
naloxone rapidly reverses the effects of opioid drugs, restoring normal
respiration. The medication can be given by intranasal spray (into the
nose), intramuscular (into the muscle), subcutaneous (under the skin), or
intravenous injection. It is a temporary treatment and its effects do not
last long. Therefore, it is critical to obtain medical intervention as soon as
possible after administering or receiving naloxone.

The use of naloxone is a **harm reduction strategy for overdose
prevention**. Overdose prevention includes taking steps to reduce the risk
of overdose in the first place, responding to an overdose by administering
naloxone or other opioid overdose reversal medications, and referring the
person to harm reduction services and supports.

[Text box on the right side]
**Harm Reduction** is an evidence-
based, practical, and transformative
approach that incorporates public
health strategies—including
prevention, risk reduction, and
health promotion—to empower
people who use drugs (PWUD)
and their families with the choice
to live healthier, self-directed, and
purpose-filled lives. Harm reduction
centers the lived and living
experience of PWUD, especially
those in under-served communities,
in these strategies and the practices
that flow from them.
[End of text box][LLM OCR returned no text for this page]CHAPTER 6: Evidence-based Practices301

The following are signs and symptoms of an opioid overdose:

» Unconsciousness or inability to awaken.
» Slow or shallow breathing or difficulty breathing such as choking sounds or a gurgling/snoring noise from a person who cannot be awakened.
» Fingernails or lips turning blue/purple. For lighter skinned people, the skin tone may turn bluish purple; for darker skinned people, skin tone may turn pale/grayish or ashen.
» Pinpointed pupils or pupils that don’t react to light.

People with physical dependence on opioids may have withdrawal
symptoms within minutes after they are given naloxone. Withdrawal
symptoms might include headaches, changes in blood pressure, rapid
heart rate, sweating, nausea, vomiting, and tremors. While this is
uncomfortable, it is usually not life threatening. The risk of death for
someone overdosing on opioids is worse than the risk of having a bad
reaction to naloxone. If the person does not respond to the intervention
or the person who is trying to help doesn’t know what to do, placing an
immediate call to 911 is critical.

Naloxone works if a person has opioids in their system and has no
harmful effect if opioids are absent. Naloxone should be given to any
person who shows signs of an opioid overdose or when an overdose is
suspected. Overdoses involving highly potent synthetic opioids (e.g.,
fentanyl) or large quantities of opioids may require multiple doses of
naloxone. If respiratory function does not improve, naloxone doses may
be repeated every two to three minutes. **For more detailed information
about how to administer naloxone, the SAMHSA Overdose Prevention
and Response Toolkit is an excellent resource.**

People who witness an overdose are often afraid to intervene or to call for help because emergency medical
services (EMS) responders are often accompanied by law enforcement officers, and many aspects of the use
of controlled substances in the US remain illegal. To encourage bystanders to intervene, most states have
enacted overdose “Good Samaritan” legislation that provides limited immunity from criminal penalty charges
to individuals who intervene, as well as, in most cases, the person who overdosed. As of March 2024, 48
jurisdictions (47 states and the District of Columbia) have enacted both “Good Samaritan” and Naloxone Access
laws. Kansas, Texas, and Wyoming do not have a Good Samaritan law for drug overdoses but have a Naloxone
Access law.113 Naloxone Access laws provide for the availability of naloxone, allowing pharmacists to distribute
naloxone without a personal prescription, protect individuals who administer naloxone in good faith from legal
liability, and sometimes include provisions for training and education on the use of naloxone to prevent overdose
deaths.

SUD counselors, particularly those who work with people with OUD, need to understand the use, benefits,
and risks of naloxone to effectively support individuals at risk of opioid overdose. By being knowledgeable
about naloxone, counselors can educate clients on its life-saving potential, guide its proper use during
emergencies, and manage expectations regarding its limitations and the possibility of withdrawal symptoms
post-administration. This understanding is crucial for developing comprehensive treatment plans that
include overdose prevention strategies, thereby improving patient safety and outcomes in opioid dependence
management.

302 IC&RC Alcohol and Drug Counselor (ADC) Certification Examination Study Guide

**EVIDENCE-BASED APPROACHES TO SUSTAIN RECOVERY**

Throughout this study guide, the four major domains that support a life in recovery have been stressed: health, home, purpose, and community. Counselors can help clients recovering from SUDs to promote a healthy life by connecting them with a range of tools and resources that have been found to be effective within these domains. This means getting the basics right, making sure that people have access to the material resources and supports they need—things such as money, food, housing, transport, physical health care, personal safety. However, it also involves going beyond mere survival and should be about enabling people to make the most of their lives, accessing those activities, roles, and relationships that they value.¹¹⁴

Counselors can support people in recovery by partnering with the many and varied community organizations available, or with a health care provider or case manager who can offer resources to encourage skill building in these four domains (see Chapter 7. Case Management for details on partnering). This support can help optimize autonomy and independence, allowing clients to lead, manage, and exercise choice over decisions that support their long-term recovery. Building skills in these four domains also increases a client’s resilience, or their ability to cope with life’s challenges, and be better prepared for the next stressful situation.¹¹⁵

**Health**

Managing physical health, especially chronic conditions, in individuals with SUDs involves integrating evidence-based practices that address both the substance use and the chronic health condition. As presented in Chapter 3, many chronic health conditions are intertwined with SUDs – HIV, hepatitis, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, tobacco use, to name a few. Because of the diversity of these health conditions, multidisciplinary care teams, including physicians, nurses, psychologists, and counselors, often work together to create and implement a comprehensive care plan. It is beyond the scope of this study guide to direct learners to such a variety of potential EBPs that address specific diseases or conditions.

[Image: The right edge of the image shows the black spiral binding of a book.]

[Text box with grey background on the left side of the page]
Self-management in chronic
diseases is defined as “the
individual’s ability to manage the
symptoms, treatment, physical and
psychosocial consequences and
lifestyle changes inherent in living
with a chronic condition.”¹¹⁸
[End of text box]

There are numerous programs, however, in the category of Self-
Management Support (SMS) programs that engage individuals in their
own care as a strategy for integrated person-centered health services.
These programs emphasize patient/client responsibility for working with
health care providers to learn about and actively identify challenges
and solve problems associated with their chronic health conditions. In
addition, these programs are evidence-based and have been shown to
be effective in managing a wide range of chronic conditions, including
diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory conditions, and mental
health disorders (MHD).¹¹⁶

A 2023 systematic review of published research on SMS programs found
many similarities among the programs. Although there are differences
based on the disease or condition, most SMS programs have mixed
interventions with strategies aimed at education, patient activation and health coaching, physical activity,
support (incl. providing feedback) and counseling, problem identification/solving, decision-making, self-
monitoring, reinforcing support tools, lifestyle adaptations, and goal setting/developing action plans. Research
found positive outcomes associated with educational interventions, patient activation and health coaching
interventions, physical interventions, and lifestyle components.⁸

SUD counselors can support long-term health and well-being by offering resources in general about the benefits
of a healthy diet, regular exercise, and healthy sleep habits. Counselors can also research available SMS programs
in their area or online and link clients to preventive and primary care services.[Layout: Single column of text with a header. The header contains "CHAPTER 6: Evidence-based Practices" on the left and the page number "303" on the right. A visual representation of a spiral binding is present on the left margin of the page.]

CHAPTER 6: Evidence-based Practices 303

**Home**

Housing supports the long-term recovery of people recovering from SUDs. People may face barriers to obtaining
and maintaining stable housing due to discrimination, having a criminal background or poor credit history, and
systemic disenfranchisement. To support clients in this area, counselors should be aware of the barriers clients
may face and provide information and resources about how to maintain stable housing and help clients develop
life skills, including financial literacy (for example, how to keep a budget and minimize debt), and create long-
lasting relationships with family and friends. Counselors should also connect clients with a case manager or
social worker to assist with additional housing needs.

Several types of housing models and programs exist that may address the needs of those recovering from
problematic substance use. These models, described below, may focus on people recovering from substance use–
related problems or address other needs, such as homelessness or income barriers. Each program has a different
philosophical approach and eligibility requirements.

**SUPPORTIVE HOUSING**

**Permanent Supportive Housing¹¹⁹** is an evidence-based model used for individuals or families experiencing
homelessness who also have a disability or other co-occurring condition, which can include SUDs. This type of
housing offers a combination of housing and services designed for clients experiencing chronic homelessness.
Permanent supportive housing is guided by the principles of **Housing First**, a philosophy that emphasizes
immediate access to housing with supports and case management, but without the preconditions of abstinence
or mandatory participation in supportive services is an innovative and proven solution to some communities'
toughest problems. It combines affordable housing with services that help people who face the most complex
challenges to live with stability, autonomy, and dignity.

Supportive housing is funded through many federal agencies and developed by packaging together housing that
is affordable to persons with very low or extremely low incomes with flexible supportive services. These housing
programs across the country vary in terms of their structure, intensity of supportive services, length of time
of housing, eligibility requirements and the needs of the populations served. Programs offer varying degrees of
client support, yet nearly all include case management. Most supportive housing models accept families with
serious behavioral health disorders with the condition that there was no active substance abuse and that there
was a demonstrated interest in supportive services.

**Housing First** is a national approach to connect individuals and families experiencing homelessness quickly
and successfully to permanent housing. The Housing First approach views housing as the foundation for
life improvement and is guided by the belief that people need necessities like food and a place to live before
attending to anything less critical, such as getting a job, budgeting properly, or attending to substance use
issues. Additionally, Housing First is based on the theory that client choice is valuable in housing selection and
supportive service participation; exercising that choice is likely to make a client more successful in remaining
housed and improving their life. Housing First programs remove barriers faced by households trying to attain
permanent housing, and do not require prerequisites to access housing support beyond what is required in
a tenant’s lease. Since homelessness and substance use often overlap and the harms of substance use are
exacerbated by homelessness, housing in this context is considered an effective harm reduction strategy.¹²⁰

**Transitional Housing** offers interim stability and support to allow an individual to successfully move to and
maintain permanent housing. Unlike permanent supportive housing where residents dictate how long they want
to stay in the program, the length of stay for an individual in transitional housing is determined by the program.
Although the length of stay in transitional housing programs may vary, residents can stay in these programs for
up to 24 months. In transitional housing, residents receive supportive services, including around problematic
substance use. Transitional housing typically offers structure, supervision, life skills information, and in some
cases, education, and training. Program participants may be required to take part in supportive services that
are not disability-related services as a condition of participation in the program. For example, if the purpose of
the project is to assist participants with SUDs, projects may require participants to take part in SUD treatment
services.¹²¹[Layout: The page has a header at the top. The main content area consists of text organized under headings. An image is positioned to the right of the "Purpose" section and below the "RECOVERY RESIDENCES" section. A spiral binding is visible on the right edge of the page.]

304 IC&RC Alcohol and Drug Counselor (ADC) Certification Examination Study Guide

**RECOVERY RESIDENCES**

For people who are newly sober, recovery housing can provide time and support as they learn how to sustain long-term recovery. In 2012, the National Association of Recovery Residences (NARR) published A Primer on Recovery Residences: FAQs,¹²² a document developed in collaboration with leading researchers in the field of recovery housing to define standards of operation across four levels of recovery residences.

Recovery residences are increasingly viewed as a viable and cost-effective option. These homes are a good option because they provide safe and healthy environments that support residents in their recovery. These communities empower people by providing support as they transition towards living independent and productive lives in their respective communities. Recovery homes offer a unique alternative for harm reduction—a component of the Housing First model—for individuals whose main goal is to find a sober living environment.¹²³

**Purpose**

Developing a sense of purpose is critical for long-term recovery and allows clients to both avoid substance use-related behaviors and engage in experiences that are enjoyable and rewarding. Counselors can support clients in developing a sense of purpose by offering tools so they can rewrite their personal narrative, pursue educational and employment opportunities, engage in volunteerism, and identify meaningful leisure activities.

One evidence-based practice – **Supported Employment (SE)** – is an approach to vocational rehabilitation for youth and adults with serious behavioral health conditions that emphasizes helping them obtain competitive work in the community and providing the supports necessary to ensure their success in the workplace. Services are individualized and consistent with the unique strengths, abilities, interests, and informed choice of the individual to help them succeed. SE programs help persons in recovery find jobs that pay competitive wages in integrated settings (i.e., with other people who don’t necessarily have disabilities) in the community.¹²⁴

**Community**

There is consistent evidence showing that recovery pathways are initiated and enhanced by positive social networks and the underlying changes in social identity that is associated with the transition from stigmatized groups to positive and prosocial groups.¹²⁵ There is also a growing literature that focuses on community engagement as a vital ingredient of recovery journeys, with engagement in recreational activities, training and employment, volunteering, and mutual aid and other peer activities seen as important components of a Recovery-Oriented System of Care (ROSC).¹²⁶ This is know as **social inclusion** – which encompasses the opportunity for the recovering individual to participate in key functions or activities and in economic, social and cultural life of their community, exercising the rights of their citizenship and enjoying an adequate standard of living and wellbeing.¹²⁷[Layout: Single column of text with a header and a footer. The left edge of the page shows a spiral binding.]

CHAPTER 6: Evidence-based Practices 305

Becoming involved with social groups can offer a sense of meaning to people and motivate them to become responsible for other group members, giving a sense of wellbeing and purposefulness that stems from a feeling of **belonging**. The human need to belong and be part of the collective can be a motivator for extending the self beyond the individual perspective and contribute significantly to a meaningful existence.¹²⁸ SUD counselors can foster belonging and social inclusion by helping clients learn about and connect to various community and social supports, such as peer recovery support specialists, 12-Step and mutual-help groups, recovery community organizations, and digital aids, such as online support groups, which can expand a client’s network beyond the immediate community.

**Recovery community organizations** (RCOs) and **recovery community centers** (RCCs) are invaluable resources for information, training, and partnership for SUD treatment programs.¹²⁹ **RCOs** are local, typically nonprofit organizations that support people with problematic substance use in achieving long-term recovery through a range of activities that can include peer support services, advocacy in the community, and public education about recovery. Not all RCOs have a physical location. RCOs are led and staffed mainly by people in recovery.

An RCC, a type of RCO, is a physical place where people in recovery, and people who want to be in recovery, can meet, get peer support services and other support, and participate in social activities like computer workshops and game nights. RCCs are central sites for recovery support groups, recovery-focused social networking, skill-building, advocacy, and volunteer activities. These settings offer a safe place for people to pursue their recovery goals and access resources.

**Peer-based recovery support services**, as shown in Chapter 2, are delivered by people with the lived experience of recovery from substance use or a mental health condition, either as a person in long-term recovery or a family member or significant other. Peer support offers a level of acceptance, understanding, and validation not found in many other professional relationships. By sharing their own lived experience and practical guidance, peer support workers help people to develop their own goals, create strategies for self-empowerment, and take concrete steps towards building fulfilling, self-determined lives for themselves.

Peer-based recovery support is the process of giving and receiving nonprofessional, non-clinical assistance to achieve long-term recovery. Peer supporters walk alongside people in recovery, offering individualized supports and demonstrating that recovery is possible. They share tools that can complement or replace clinical supports by providing strategies for self-empowerment and achieving a self-determined life.¹³⁰ Oftentimes, peer-based recovery support is provided by a person certified as a Recovery Peer Specialist – which brings the lived experience of recovery, combined with training and supervision, to assist others in initiating and maintaining recovery.

An SUD counselor’s tasks are to understand the different types and cultures of these communities of recovery as well as how they align with individuals’ chosen recovery pathways and cultural backgrounds.[Layout: The page has a header at the top and a main body of text.

306 IC&RC Alcohol and Drug Counselor (ADC) Certification Examination Study Guide

SUMMARY

The use of therapeutic practices that are supported by scientific evidence is crucial in counseling work. It ensures that the interventions employed are effective and reliable for treating clients. Evidence-based practices (EBPs) have been rigorously tested in controlled studies and have demonstrated consistent, positive outcomes in addressing specific disorders, including substance use disorders. Employing EBPs increases the likelihood of successful client outcomes, enhances the quality of care, and ensures accountability in the treatment process. By grounding counseling work in scientifically validated methods, counselors can make informed decisions about tailored interventions with more confidence. This chapter highlights behavioral treatments like Motivational Interviewing (MI) and Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) as they are foundational in their application and effectiveness in treating SUDs across diverse populations and intervention types (community reinforcement approaches, mindfulness-based interventions, family therapies, and trauma-focused treatments).

This chapter also advocates for an integrated treatment approach combining medications with counseling and behavioral therapies. The use of Medication-Assisted Treatments (MAT) for alcohol and opioid use disorders, is an area of continued research and development; however, existing approaches have been well tested and underscore the significance of MAT in managing withdrawal symptoms, reducing cravings, and supporting long-term recovery.

SUD counselors need to be familiar with a variety of evidence-based practices to effectively address the diverse needs and backgrounds of their clients. They also need to be knowledgeable of and use effective practices to support the recovery domains of Health, Home, Purpose, and Community. Since SUDs can vary widely in their severity, nature, and the personal circumstances of the individuals affected, a one-size-fits-all approach is inadequate. By understanding and being skilled in a range of therapeutic modalities, counselors can tailor their treatment plans to the specific needs, preferences, and backgrounds of each client, thereby increasing the likelihood of successful outcomes.[Layout: Two columns with a header.]
