CHAPTER 9
PROFESSIONAL, ETHICAL AND
LEGAL RESPONSIBILITIES360 IC&RC Alcohol and Drug Counselor (ADC) Certification Examination Study Guide

**INTRODUCTION**

Substance use disorder (SUD) counselors have mandates for professional and ethical conduct when fulfilling their job responsibilities. Counselors are, first, advocates with the ethical mandate to provide for the right care at the right time in support of health and behavioral health goals determined by the individual and/or the family/ support system. In addition, they are expected to protect and defend the rights of their clients/families, and advance the health, human and social outcomes of the people they serve.

In general, **ethical standards** are developed for the protection of four distinct groups:
» The client
» The professional
» The profession
» The community¹

[Image: A black and white photograph showing a diverse group of seven adults, appearing to be professionals, standing together and smiling. They are dressed in smart casual attire. The setting seems to be an office or a similar professional environment. From left to right: an older man with a white beard holding a coffee cup; a man with a dark beard and short hair; a man with glasses and a light-colored collared shirt; a woman with dark, shoulder-length hair; an older woman with glasses and light-colored, shoulder-length hair; a man with short dark hair; and a woman with dark, curly hair holding a notebook. The image is slightly out of focus in the background. The image likely represents the professionals or the community mentioned in the text.]CHAPTER 9: Professional, Ethical and Legal Responsibilities 361

[Image: A stylized, angled graphic in the top right quadrant of the page. It features several words in bold, black, serif font on white rectangular pieces of paper arranged in a slightly overlapping, fanned-out manner. The largest and most prominent word is "Ethics". Above and to the left of "Ethics" is the word "Principles", partially obscured. To the right and slightly below "Ethics" are "Valu" (partially obscured, likely "Values") and "Duty". Below "Duty" is the word "Fairnes" (partially obscured, likely "Fairness"). A small portion of another word, possibly starting with "AL" or "VL", is visible at the very bottom left of the graphic.]

The needs of these four groups are not always
clearly understood, articulated, or aligned.
Ethical conflicts and dilemmas arise when
there are unclear or conflicting needs between
the four groups. These conflicts may occur
when it is uncertain which needs or values are
most applicable or conflict with one another.
Mechanisms for resolving such conflicts may
be found in agency policies and procedures,
governing regulations such as licensure rules or
state statutes, and the policies of credentialing/
accrediting bodies (such as the Joint Commission).

It is the responsibility of the counselor to be
knowledgeable about and abide by all laws,
regulations, policies, and ethical codes that apply
to their area of practice. Even though ethical
practices are established for the benefit of the
client, the primary responsibility for ethical
practice and identifying ethical breaches rests
with the professional. In addition, counselors
have a responsibility for self-governance within
the profession – meaning they should be able to
identify and respond appropriately both to their
own ethical breaches and those of their peers.

Even though there is a high degree of commonality between ethical codes used in various helping professionals,
there may be great variation in how those codes are interpreted, monitored, and enforced. It is important to
recognize that many questions related to professional ethics rely on subjective interpretation and that not
everyone involved will agree about whether an ethical breach has occurred in any given situation. The “gray
area” into which many ethical conflicts fall presents a challenge for both the client and the professional. Clear
boundaries and communication between the client and the SUD counselor are essential to help avoid ethical
problems.

Ethical standards both prescribe and prohibit specific behaviors on the part of the counselor. Ethical codes, rules,
and regulations often indicate what a counselor should or must do, while other elements describe what should
not or cannot be done. Often, more attention is paid to the ethical standards that deal with prohibited behavior,
such as breaches of confidentiality or inappropriate touch, than to the prescribed behaviors, such as respect for
diversity, cultural humility, and ongoing professional development. This may be because prohibited behaviors
are perceived to result in greater harm to the client. Failure to act in prescribed ways that are consistent with
best practices and ethical standards, however, may also result in harm to the client, the profession, and the
community. It is important, therefore, to explore all aspects of ethical standards to ensure the greatest good for
all.

SUD counselors also have a professional responsibility to seek and use appropriate supervision and consultation
to improve their professional skills and ensure that they are meeting the needs of their clients. Completing
appropriate continuing professional education courses to improve skills and keep up-to-date with developments
in the field is one of their ethical responsibilities.362 IC&RC Alcohol and Drug Counselor (ADC) Certification Examination Study Guide

**OVERVIEW OF PROFESSIONAL ETHICS**

When a new field of practice becomes a recognized profession, members of the profession define their own standards and the ethical parameters under which they will operate. The formal establishment of a code of ethics is a milestone in the development of a particular profession and defines the standards of expected behavior for members of that profession.

Training in professional ethics is required for most state boards that regulate professionals, including SUD counselors. Candidates for certification are often required to sign the code of ethics as part of the certification process. **Codes of ethical conduct** govern many diverse helping professions and help assure a level of professional behavior that can be expected from members of a particular profession. These codes, however, may not provide the practical or detailed guidance needed for dealing with day-to-day situations. Simply following a list of specific rules of conduct does not ensure that the counselor will practice in an ethical manner since any list cannot possibly cover every situation. As a result, it is important that the counselor be schooled in ethical decision making to handle situations that may not be described in the rules or code.

CHAPTER 9: Professional, Ethical and Legal Responsibilities 363

**Ethical Principles**

The foundation of professional ethics encompasses four dimensions that, when brought together, represent the positive ethical ideals and values of the health care and helping professions.²

[Table: 3 columns, 5 rows. Column headers are: Principle, Description, Simply Stated.]
| Principle | Description | Simply Stated |
|---|---|---|
| **Principle of Respect for Autonomy** | Autonomy refers to the right of the client to retain control over their care. A counselor can suggest or advise, but any actions that attempt to persuade or coerce the client into making a choice are violations of this principle. In the end, the client must be allowed to make their own decisions independently and according to personal values and beliefs - whether the counselor believes these choices are in that client’s best interests. | Have a duty to not interfere with the decisions of competent adults and a duty to empower others who need assistance in making decisions about their care. |
| **Principle of Nonmaleficence** | Non-maleficence is probably the best known of the four principles. In short, it means, “to do no harm.” This principle is intended to be the basis for all counselor decisions and means that consideration must be given to whether other people or society could be harmed by a decision made, even if it is made for the benefit of an individual client. | Must take positive steps to prevent harm. |
| **Principle of Beneficence** | This principle means that counselors must do all they can to benefit the client in each situation. All services recommended must be with the intention to do the most good for the client and must consider the client’s individual circumstances; what is good for one client will not necessary benefit another. | Must develop and maintain a high level of knowledge and skills to ensure that clients receive the most effective services and supports. |
| **Principle of Justice** | The principle of justice states that counselors will uphold applicable laws and legislation when making choices and that there should be an element of fairness in all health care decisions. This also relates to fairness in decisions that relate to equal distribution of scarce resources. | Have an obligation to uphold the law and to work for the benefit of those who may be unfairly treated. |

**Applicable Laws and Regulations**

At the core of the SUD counselor’s work is the interplay of ethical codes with standards of practice and laws, rules, and regulations governing professional practice. It is often said that **legal** involves the “black and white” of practice requirements, whereas **ethics** is about the “gray” – if not all the shades in between.

Many states regulate the counseling professions with laws that establish defined duties and minimum standards of practice. There may also be additional laws or regulations such as those that are based on whether the SUD counselor is certified or licensed, or an organization’s contracts or accreditations.

**SUD counselors are expected to adhere to federal and jurisdictionally specific rules and regulations regarding best practices in substance use disorder treatment to protect and promote client rights.** In particular, when public funds are used, there is an obligation to fulfill the public trust. This commonly results in publicly funded programs being held to higher standards than the same services offered from the private industry. Ordinarily,[Layout: Single column with a header. The right edge of the page shows a spiral binding.]

364 IC&RC Alcohol and Drug Counselor (ADC) Certification Examination Study Guide

there is congruence or consistency between public and private levels of accountability. Sometimes, however,
there are disparities between the various governing requirements or one or more of the areas listed above do not
address the issue at hand. In these circumstances it becomes especially important that the SUD counselor has
a strong ethical orientation along with access to supervision and consultation that can help guide careful and
ethical decision-making.

**CODES OF ETHICS**

A **code of ethics** is a set of principles of conduct within a professional that guide decision making and behavior. The
purpose of the code is to provide members of a specific professional, and other interested persons, with
guidelines for making ethical choices in the conduct of their work. Members of the profession adopt a code of
ethics to share a dedication to ethical behavior and adopt this code to declare their principles and standards of
practice.³

Ethical guidelines are externally defined, however, the will to behave according to these principles is an
internal decision made by the professional. In every interaction with clients, community members, and other
professionals, an SUD counselor makes conscious choices about how to act and interact with others. These
choices not only reflect personal values and standards but must be guided by the external standards that are
imposed by the profession's code of ethics.

Codes can be regarded as blueprints for the relationship between the professional and the client. Professional
ethics reflect what most members of that profession have agreed on in a formal process and "best practices"
rather than reflecting ideal standards that are consistently unattainable. Professional codes of ethics are
necessary and useful, but they have some limitations. For example, it is sometimes easier to identify when
something forbidden has occurred than to verify that everything that is recommended has taken place.

Most codes are general in nature and reflect the consensus of professionals in each field at a single point in time.
This generality, however, can be viewed as vague or confusing to some practitioners. For this reason, certain
issues cannot be handled by ethical codes alone and must be supplemented by laws, regulations, and policies.
In addition, when the practice of a profession is rapidly adapting and evolving, published codes may lag behind
the needs and demands of day-to-day practice. This is why it is important for professionals to understand not
only the listed standards but also the principles that lie behind their respective codes of ethics. This is one area
where the "reasonable person test" (applying common sense) may be used to determine the most ethical course
of action.

While there is **no universally accepted** code of ethics for all counseling professionals, the prevailing codes of
ethics have enough commonalities that we can provide reliable guidance for SUD counselors in this study guide.
Each SUD counselor should be familiar with the codes of ethics from their state, territory, or tribe as well as any
other codes that apply to them.

**Foundations of Ethics**

Ethics are based on moral values — a sense of what is right and wrong. The perception of morality focuses on
the meeting point between personal freedom and the good of broader society. Professional ethics focuses on
the intersection between client rights and professional duties. Ethical conflicts or dilemmas occur when the
perception of what is appropriate conduct within a particular context is unclear or is not clearly communicated
between the parties involved with that interaction. Professionals may respond to ethical questions in different
ways, all of which may be ethically sound.

Ethical conflicts for SUD counselors arise in three basic contexts:

1. Failure to comply with the law, governing policies and ethical codes.
2. Personal dilemmas where the professional knows what is right, but is tempted to do wrong.
3. Moral dilemmas when there are conflicting rights or conflicting wrongs.[Layout: The page has a header with the chapter title on the left and the page number on the right. The main content is a single column of text, with an image embedded on the right side of the page, spanning approximately the first two paragraphs of text.]

CHAPTER 9: Professional, Ethical and Legal Responsibilities 365

When compliance with a law or policy is mandatory,
**failure to comply** becomes an ethical issue. There
may be sanctions or consequences associated with
such an ethical breach. One example of this is the
mandatory reporting of suspected abuse or neglect
of a child or vulnerable adult. Professionals who
become aware of potential abuse or neglect in
these populations are required by law to report it
and failure to do so can result in fines and other
disciplinary actions.

SUD counselors may also encounter personal
dilemmas in the professional environment. An
example of a **personal dilemma** within an ethical
context is when a professional engages in a dual
relationship with a client. A dual relationship occurs
when the professional engages in another type of
interaction outside of the service setting such as a
social or business relationship. This includes meeting
for a casual lunch, becoming friends on social media,
and engaging in personal business transactions.
Such dual relationships can lead to role confusion
and blurred boundaries between the two parties. This type of dual relationship may not be specifically forbidden
either in law or outlined in an ethical code of conduct, but it is an unethical practice since it is clearly not in the
best interest of the client.¹

**Ethical or moral dilemmas** in counseling are complex situations where professionals encounter conflicts between
different ethical principles, personal values, and professional obligations. These dilemmas often involve making
difficult decisions that can have significant consequences for both the counselor and the client. Ethical dilemmas
can best be resolved by applying the principles of ethical decision-making. There may be instances of a conflict
in values, when an objective third party must decide which position carries the greater
potential for good or the least potential for harm. The same is true when both positions in an ethical question
are wrong, but one will certainly prevail. In this case, the old axiom, “the lesser of two evils” comes into play to
resolve the conflict. It is important to remember that not acting and doing nothing is often a choice and must be
considered as one of the potential courses of action.

Consider the scenario where an SUD counselor has fervently advocated for specialized service needs for a client
and is denied the service by a higher authority due to competing demands for funds. The counselor feels a strong
sense of responsibility for the client and accountability for client outcomes but does not have authority for the
decision. When the decision is perceived by the counselor to be “inferior ethical prioritizing,” the counselor
experiences a moral dilemma. Repeated incidents such as this put the counselor at risk for **moral distress**. Moral
distress can be manifested as: anger, anxiety, depression, disgust, guilt, sadness, worry, self-blame or doubt,
absenteeism, or even leaving the profession altogether.⁴

**Moral sense** is having a personal understanding of the difference between right and wrong. Moral sense is
developed over time based on life experiences and internalizing values through social learning. Moral sense is
often what we refer to as “conscience,” or the internal voice that tells us right from wrong. People often assume
that their moral sense is healthy, that their values are shared by others, and that their beliefs are correct and
appropriate for professional work.⁵

SUD counselors must continually work to maintain a healthy moral sense and be attuned to possible moral
distress. Because a code of ethics cannot possibly deal with every situation that could potentially occur, it is
important for counselors to have a highly developed moral sense that guides them in their day-to-day behavior.
A general rule is that if an action seems uncomfortable or does not “feel right,” the counselor should seek
supervision or consultation to confirm the ethical constraints and boundaries before taking any further action.

**Ethical Decision-Making**

SUD counselors are often faced with a balancing act of multiple priorities or conflicts, which can be difficult. Most decisions must be made on a case-by-case basis. There is considerable pressure on service providers to coordinate with multiple stakeholders, and have responsibilities that put them at the forefront of contact with payers and providers. These expectations are complex and, at times, may appear to conflict, requiring judgment and critical thinking skills.⁶ In these situations, attention to ethical issues may a part of the decision-making process.

When deliberation is needed, it is important to identify, to the extent possible, the specifically ethical aspects of the issue at hand. Sometimes what appears to be an ethical dispute is really a dispute about facts or concepts. Making ethical decisions requires sensitivity to the ethical implications of problems and situations. It also requires practice. Having a framework for ethical decision making is essential.⁷

[Table: 2 columns, 7 rows including the header row. Column headers are: Steps, Actions.]
| Steps | Actions |
|---|---|
| **Consider the Parties Involved** | Reflect upon the various individuals and groups who may be affected by your decision. Consider who might be harmed or who might benefit. |
| **Gather all Relevant Information** | Ensure that you have gathered all pertinent information, and that all potential sources of information have been consulted. *.* |
| **Formulate Actions and Consider Alternatives** | Evaluate your decision-making options by asking the following questions: <br> > Which action will produce the “most good” and do the least harm? <br> > Which action respects the rights of all who have a stake in the decision? <br> > Which action treats people equally or proportionately? <br> > Which action serves the community, not just some members? <br> > Which action leads me to act as the sort of person I should be? |
| **Make a Decision and Consider It** | After examining all potential actions, which best addresses the situation? Ask - How do I feel about my choice? |
| **Act** | Many ethical situations are uncomfortable because we can never have all the information. Even so, we must often act. |
| **Reflect on the Outcome** | Evaluate the outcome of your decision. Ask: <br> > What were the results of my decision? <br> > What were the intended and unintended consequences? <br> > Would I change anything now that I have seen the consequences? |

**PROFESSIONAL BEHAVIOR**

**Operate in a Competent and Theoretically Sound Manner**

Every profession defines itself by establishing what is called a **scope of practice**. The scope of practice defines the actions that a member of the profession is trained and authorized to perform and may be defined by the credentialing body. SUD counselors have an ethical responsibility to identify and evaluate duties that are both inside and outside of their scope of practice and refer to other professionals as indicated. That is, they should practice within both the limitations of this defined scope as well as their own professional competence. Competence can be indicated by education, experience, training, and credentialing.

Many states have established or mandated a scope(s) of practice for SUD counselors, along with licensing and/ or credentialing requirements. Scopes of practice generally extend from entry level positions requiring a high school diploma or GED through positions that require increased formal degree programs (bachelor, master, doctorate). The types of substance use disorder services and level of professional privileges vary for the various scopes of practice. It is essential that all SUD counselors are aware of the rules, regulations, and the boundaries within which they can work. Violation of the professional scope of practice often results in a loss of licensure or certification and may be pursued legally.

SUD counselors can increase their professional competence by understanding their strengths and weaknesses. It is important to understand that competence in one area doesn’t necessarily translate to another. Counselors with experience in working with adults may not have the skill set to meet the specific needs of an adolescent or an older adult. Counselors should have at least a basic understanding of issues related to substance use, mental health, and trauma issues. In addition, it is important to understand how personal biases, values, experiences, and feelings can enhance client rapport and where they may become a hindrance.

It is important to seek professional development throughout one’s career. Engaging in professional education, training, self-evaluation, supervision, and consultation helps the counselor maintain competence and enhance professional effectiveness. Continuing education helps enhance current skills and knowledge, develop new skills and knowledge, and stay current about the most recent developments in the field including new and evolving evidence-based practices. Continuing education is so important that most states require that certified and licensed professionals, including SUD counselors, receive ongoing continuing education for obtaining and maintaining certification and licensure.

**MAINTAIN APPROPRIATE RELATIONSHIP BOUNDARIES**

Boundaries in a counseling relationship are the often-invisible barriers that affect how the SUD counselor and client interact. **Boundary violations** occur when counselors cross the line of decency and violate or exploit their clients and misuse their power to exploit a client for the counselor’s own benefit. Boundary violations usually involve exploitive business or sexual relationships. Boundary violations are always unethical and are likely to be illegal.

**Boundary crossings** are another issue. They can be ethical or unethical depending upon the actions and intent of the SUD counselor; or they can augment effective interventions such as appropriate self-disclosure, home visits, or non-sexual touch. It is important that SUD counselors differentiate between harmful boundary violations and helpful boundary crossings.⁹

[Image: A black and white, slightly grainy photograph showing a close-up of a hand holding a piece of paper. The paper has the words "SET BOUNDARIES" printed on it in large, bold, black, sans-serif capital letters. The word "SET" is above the word "BOUNDARIES". The background is out of focus, suggesting a wooden surface or similar texture. The image conveys the concept of establishing or defining limits.]370 IC&RC Alcohol and Drug Counselor (ADC) Certification Examination Study Guide

Many of the ethical principles regarding boundaries focus on the issue of dual relationships. **Dual relationships** refer to relationships outside of the professional role, such as developing a friendship or engaging in a business transaction with clients. Dual relationships can damage a counselor's objectivity or unintentionally exploit a client's dependence on the counselor.

Dual and multiple relationships can be complex requiring counselors to make judgment calls and apply the codes of ethics carefully to specific situations. Dual or multiple relationships can evolve in subtle ways. Some counselors may somewhat innocently establish a form of nonprofessional relationship.¹⁰ Some of the ways this **boundary crossing** is manifested is:
*   Taking phone calls between sessions (if not an emergency or previously agreed upon)
*   Small gifts (giving and accepting)
*   Special fee arrangements or bartering
*   Excessive counselor self-disclosure/disclosure of personal information
*   Saying “yes” rather than “no” (when no is the more appropriate response)
*   Making special allowances for a client
*   Non-emergency meetings outside of the office or after office hours

Although dual relationships are not damaging to clients in all cases, the SUD counselor must be aware that the potential for harm is always present. Errors in judgment often occur when the counselor's own interests become part of the equation. This loss of objectivity is one factor that increases the risk of harm.¹¹

It is essential the SUD counselor set appropriate relationships and ensure they are consistently maintained. This is the responsibility of the professional, not the client. That is not to say that the counselor is responsible if a client intentionally or unintentionally commits a boundary violation; it is the responsibility of the counselor, however, to recognize that the violation has occurred, inform the client of the inappropriate behavior, and identify appropriate solutions.

Many clients have experienced boundary difficulties in their lives, both as a result and outside of behavioral health conditions. This includes unclear or damaged boundaries within the family, in other interpersonal relationships, and social experiences. This makes it all the more critical that appropriate boundaries are defined at the outset of the professional relationship rather than addressing boundaries when a problem arises.

It is important that the SUD counselor not only defines but models clear and appropriate boundaries for the client. Clear boundaries protect both the counselor and the client. Some clients may find the discussion of boundaries uncomfortable, and others may question the need for boundaries. The counselor should make the reason for boundaries clear to the client and secure the agreement to abide by the boundaries that govern their relationship. It can be helpful if some of the boundaries are expressed in terms of the client's rights which may make the discussion more amenable to the client and places more responsibility on the counselor to maintain good boundaries in the relationship.

**SELF-DISCLOSURE**

An SUD counselor should limit sharing personal information to circumstances when doing so is clearly relevant to the client's service goals. Counselors should carefully choose the parts of their experience that are helpful to the client and monitor how this disclosure affects the client relationship.¹² Use of supervision and peer consultation with colleagues helps to ensure that disclosure of personal information is done in the best interest of the client rather than to meet the needs of the counselor. One general rule regarding self-disclosure is that the professional should only reveal information about a personal life problem well after it has been resolved, not while it is an ongoing issue.[Image: A black and white photograph showing two women in what appears to be a counseling or therapy session. One woman, on the left, is facing away from the viewer, her head slightly bowed, with her left hand touching her face. The other woman, on the right, is facing the first woman, looking at her attentively. She is holding a pen and a notepad in her lap, suggesting she is a counselor or therapist. The focus is on their interaction, and the image conveys a sense of seriousness and support. A laptop is partially visible on a desk between them.]

CHAPTER 9: Professional, Ethical and Legal Responsibilities 371

**TOUCH**

The question of appropriate touch within the helping relationships is widely debated. Some codes of ethics may expressly forbid any type of touch between a professional and a client, while others distinguish between intimate and non-intimate physical contact. For example, offering comfort to clients with a non-sexual hug or an arm around their shoulder as they are facing tremendous challenges is often not a question of ethics. It can be considered as a humane action on the part of counselors. On the other hand, touch might be misconstrued as a sexual advance.

SUD counselors, therefore, need to be attuned to their clients and their own intentions. It is important to recognize that many persons with behavioral health diagnoses also have histories of trauma. For these clients, any type of touch within the helping relationship can create significant ethical dilemmas.¹³ Even something as simple as a hug can convey confusing messages to a client with a history of trauma. SUD counselors who have any type of physical contact with clients must have clear boundaries and an awareness that touch may complicate the professional relationship. The counselor must also clearly invite the client to discuss any discomfort that might be caused by unwanted touch and provide enough safety within the relationship that the client can raise this issue if necessary.¹⁴

**SEXUAL RELATIONSHIPS**

There is no ambiguity about the issue of sexual involvement with a client. Sexual or romantic relationships with clients are always improper, even after the professional relationship has ended. The prohibition against this behavior is almost universally incorporated into codes of ethics. As the person with the most power in the relationship, the SUD counselor has the primary responsibility of defining and maintaining this boundary. Many state licensing or certification boards impose significant consequences for professionals who violate this boundary. Sexual or romantic involvement with a client is a serious ethical violation with profound emotional repercussions for the client and significant repercussions for the professional.372 IC&RC Alcohol and Drug Counselor (ADC) Certification Examination Study Guide

RECOVERY BOUNDARIES

Persons in recovery have much to offer in the behavioral health field. Those who have successfully achieved
and maintained recovery can be understanding and successful professionals. The ability to empathize with
clients can be a significant asset. One area of concern is that professionals in recovery may be overly focused on
replicating their own journey to recovery in their work with their clients.¹⁵ For instance, SUD counselors who are
strongly 12-Step oriented may reject treatment approaches that are not abstinence-based. In this circumstance,
clients may also feel pressured to please the counselor by following their example on the road to recovery.

A counselor who has experience with problematic substance use in the past should be secure in recovery before
engaging in a professional relationship with a client. It may be difficult for SUD counselors with a comparatively
short time in recovery to be objective with clients and their clients’ issues may serve as relapse triggers for a
counselor whose sobriety is fragile. Increased consultation and supervision are recommended for professionals
with short histories in recovery.

A counselor who has a recurrence of substance use must face the ethical dilemma of whether to continue
as usual with clients or choose to limit, suspend, or terminate their clinical activities. Appropriate steps to
transition the client to a new SUD counselor should be taken when the affected counselor steps away from their
duties. These decisions should be made within the context of supervision and consultation.

Use Consultation and Supervision

SUD counselors should have a structured process for reviewing their professional skills and addressing
difficulties as they arise. Counselors who are entering new areas of practice and those who are stretching
the boundaries of their skills and experience should have more intensive supervision and consultation. Good
supervision can result in reduced burnout, creativity in resolving difficult cases, and better client care. A regular
assessment of professional skills and development is an important ethical responsibility for SUD counselors and
their agencies.

A variety of definitions for clinical supervision exist. Differences typically reflect aspects of the author’s
discipline and training focus. Bernard and Goodyear¹⁶ offer this definition that has come to be accepted within
the counseling profession:

> Supervision is an intervention that is provided by a senior member of a profession to a junior
> member or members of that same profession. This relationship is evaluative, extends over time,
> and has the simultaneous purposes of enhancing the professional functioning of the junior
> member(s), monitoring the quality of professional services offered to the clients she, he, or they
> see(s), and serving as a gatekeeper of those who are to enter the particular profession.

Simply put...the role of supervision is for counselors to have a place to go to work things out. It is also a place
to be reassured, supported, and to receive helpful and constructive feedback. Having regular supervision can
prevent counselors from “getting stuck” and allows new insights and new energy to move things forward in
clinical work.¹⁷

Supervision is fundamental to the provision of safe, ethical, and competent services. There are many benefits to
having regular and ongoing formal supervision. Supervision...
» is essential to how counselors sustain good practice throughout their working life.
» provides regular and ongoing opportunities to learn, reflect on, and get feedback and support about all
aspects of clinical practice.
» helps to maintain professional and ethical boundaries.
» provides a sounding board to voice concerns, resolve issues, and focus on self-care to avoid burnout.

Supervision can focus on how the counselor is providing services from a clinical perspective as well as an
administrative perspective. Clinically, supervision is the place where the counselor develops their knowledge and
clinical skills (both theoretically and practically), explores specific competencies, and examines their own beliefs[Layout: The page has a header at the top, a large image below the header, and a single column of text below the image.

and attitudes regarding clients and the counseling profession.18 From an administrative perspective, supervision
looks at the counselor’s adherence to policies, procedures, and regulations. The counselor has an ethical and
professional responsibility to participate in and comply with both types of supervision and to actively seek out
such supervision if it is not routinely provided.

The nature of supervision encompasses the participants in the relationship, the quality of the relationship
and its purposes. While supervision is not the same thing as counseling, there are many similarities. The core
conditions of counseling — congruence, empathy, and unconditional positive regard — are modeled through
supervisory experience. Factors that make up a successful supervisory relationship typically include: the
structure and character of the supervisory relationship; interpersonal sensitivity; task orientation; social
influence such as expertness, and trustworthiness; a strong working alliance, including agreement of goals and
tasks; and empathy, congruence, and unconditional acceptance.

**CONSULTATION**

Counselors are encouraged to understand and engage in consultation as part of their professional work.
Consultation has similarities to but distinct differences from supervision. A consultation relationship tends to be
nonhierarchical, short-term, freely sought, and nonevaluative. In general, a consultant does not have power and
control over the consultee; in essence the consultant is giving advice.19 In a consultation relationship, there is no
obligation to accept or follow any of the suggestions. Clinical supervision, on the other hand, is more hierarchical
with the supervisor in a position of knowing and being legally responsibility for liability and the actions of the
supervisee.20

Consultation can be sought out with an expert in a specialty area or informally among peers as clinical issues
or dilemmas arise. Peer consultation groups can provide a forum for SUD counselors to meet informally with
peers and colleagues to discuss clinical and practice issues in a supportive and confidential setting. They
are frequently described as small, informal, leaderless, and democratic. peer consultation groups offer both
emotional support and learning opportunities that may be lacking in everyday practice. Consultation groups
serve many functions for the counselor, including the development and refinement of therapeutic skills,
assistance with case conceptualization and treatment, maintenance of ethical standards, and emotional support
for the difficult work of therapy.21374 IC&RC Alcohol and Drug Counselor (ADC) Certification Examination Study Guide

**CULTURAL RESPONSIVENESS, DIVERSITY, EQUITY, AND INCLUSION**

Current and projected population data for the United States paints a compelling picture and underscores the importance of the need for a service delivery workforce that can serve the needs of individuals from multiple backgrounds. At the present time, the United States is 60.4% white. According to Pew Research Center, the country's racial profile will be vastly different by 2055. Whites will remain the single largest racial group in the US, but they will no longer be the majority. Growth in the Hispanic/Latino and the Asian populations in the US are predicted to almost triple over the next 40 years.22

Individuals often identify initially with broader racial, ethnic, and cultural groups. However, each person has a unique history that warrants an understanding of how culture is practiced and has evolved for the person and his or her family; accordingly, generalizations or assumptions about people should be avoided. Individuals are often part of a culture within a culture. There is not just one Hispanic/Latino, African American, or Native American culture – many variables influence culture and cultural identity.

Offering services that are responsive to current and changing demographics can have far-reaching effects not only for clients, but also for providers and communities. This requires the use of culturally-tailored, inclusive, and affirming approaches. This means offering services and support where everyone, regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disabilities, neurodiversity, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, age, religion, and any other-intersectional identities feels welcome and are treated equitably.

> **Achieving health equity** requires actions to increase opportunities for all people to be as healthy as possible. This requires improvements in the conditions that strongly influence health—including good jobs with fair pay, high-quality education, safe housing, good physical and social environments, and high-quality health care—for those who lack access and have worse health.²⁷

» **Social exclusion or marginalization** refers to barring or deterring racial/ethnic or social groups from full participation in society and from sharing the benefits of participation. Socially excluded or marginalized groups have less power and prestige and generally less wealth. Because of that, the places where they live often have health-damaging and/or non-health-promoting conditions, such as pollution, lack of access to jobs and services, and inadequate schools.²⁸

» **Implicit bias** refers to the attitudes or stereotypes that affect our understanding, actions, and decisions. It is the unintentional activation of prejudicial attitudes toward a group based on stereotypes that have receded from consciousness over time and have become invisible to the holder. These attitudes represent overlearned associations with a strong basis that are difficult to completely overwrite with recent experiences or acquired values. Such biases result in an automatic and unconscious reaction and/or behavior.²⁹

» **Intersectionality** is a concept that describes the ways in which systems of inequality based on gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, class, and other forms of discrimination “intersect” to create unique dynamics and effects. All forms of inequality are mutually reinforcing and should examined and addressed simultaneously to prevent one form of inequality from reinforcing another.³⁰

» **Cultural humility** involves understanding the complexity and shifting nature of intersecting identities and recognizing that health care providers will never be fully competent about the evolving and dynamic nature of a client’s experiences. Cultural humility requires an ongoing process of self-exploration and self-critique combined with a willingness to learn from others.³¹ It means entering a relationship with another person with the intention of honoring their beliefs, customs, and values. It means acknowledging differences and accepting that person for who they are.

» **Cultural competence** is a type of social fluency gained by learning about another culture’s language, set of customs, beliefs, and patterns. It enables service providers to tailor their approach to be culturally responsive and sensitive. One early definition identifies cultural competence as the ability to think, feel, and act in ways that acknowledge, respect, and build upon ethnic, socio-cultural, and linguistic diversity.³²
> **Cultural competence** has come to mean more than a discrete skill set or knowledge base; cultural competence also requires self-evaluation on the part of the practitioners. Culturally competent practitioners are aware of their own culture and values, and they acknowledge their own assumptions and biases about other cultures. In addition, they strive to understand how these assumptions affect their ability to provide culturally responsive services to clients from similar or diverse cultures.³³

**Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI)**

Diversity, equity, and inclusion (usually abbreviated DEI) refers to organizational frameworks which seek to promote the fair treatment and full participation of all people, particularly groups who have historically been underrepresented, marginalized, or subject to discrimination based on identity or disability.

» **Diversity** refers to the representation or composition of various social identity groups in a work group, organization, or community.

» **Equity** involves providing resources according to the need to help diverse populations achieve their highest state of health and other functioning. Equity is different than “equality” in that equality implies treating everyone as if their experiences are exactly the same. Equality assumes that everybody is the[Layout: Single column page with a header. The left edge of the page shows a spiral binding.]

CHAPTER 9: Professional, Ethical and Legal Responsibilities 377

same and everybody needs the same thing. Equity focuses on access to or distribution of resources
according to need.34

» **Inclusion** strives for an environment that offers affirmation, celebration, and appreciation of different
approaches, styles, perspectives, and experiences.

These terms are often used in an organizational context. DEI plans and actions seek to make meaningful
changes such as having a diverse workforce, improving the organizational culture to foster an inclusive
environment, creating a strong presence in diverse communities, and providing culturally responsive care.

SUD counselors also must consider how DEI affects their work. Substance use and mental health conditions
affect everyone differently and can be looked at through many lenses. Counselors need to understand how
individual differences affect substance use, mental health, and help-seeking behavior, and be adequately
prepared to deliver effective behavioral health services to diverse individuals. They also must demonstrate
commitments to creating a safe and welcoming environment, to genuineness in the therapeutic relationship, to
understand the cultural nuances of the person’s life, and having a willingness to address any issues created by
cultural and other differences.35

Diversity can be thought of as the “what” clients bring to a counseling relationship. Inclusion can be thought
of as the action or the “how” the counselor responds. Inclusion refers to the action steps taken to **intentionally**
respond to clients and respect and accept people regardless of where they come from, their physical abilities,
how they identify, and what they believe while respecting and accepting them as human beings. **Intentionality**
relates to the importance of being in the moment and responding flexibly to the ever-changing situations and
needs of clients. This art of flexibility needs to be based on solid knowledge, awareness of self and others, and
skills that are then turned into intentional action.36

It also is a part of the counselor’s professional ethics advocate for and to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion.
This begins with the counselor’s ongoing education about DEI issues, policies, practices, and laws. Advocacy can
be at the organizational level to play a part in creating organizational practices reinforce an inclusive culture.
The SUD counselor can also choose to confront the issues that create and reinforce health inequities among the
persons and communities they serve – such as, advocating for fair sentencing laws, or removal bans on specific
federal benefits for persons in recovery, or being a champion for policies that facilitate equitable access to
evidence-based prevention, treatment, harm reduction, and recovery support services.

**Developing Cultural Humility and Cultural Competence**

Stigma, bias, and discrimination on the part of providers may play a key role in perpetuating healthcare
disparities, including in the treatment of problematic substance use.37 With a foundation of cultural humility,
cultural competence and commitment to community engagement, health and behavioral health organizations
and professionals can develop and implement meaningful actions to better address health equity, health
disparities, and health inequities. For SUD counselors, it is important to begin with the fundamental aspects of
cultural humility and cultural competence.

For example, a culturally competent counselor needs to have knowledge and awareness of health-related beliefs,
practices, and cultural values of diverse populations; illness and diagnostic incidence and prevalence among
culturally and ethnically diverse populations; and treatment efficacy data (if any) of culturally and ethnically
diverse populations. A counselor operating with cultural humility must listen with interest and curiosity, have
an awareness of their own possible biases, and attempt a non-judgmental stance about what they hear, and
recognize their inherent status of privilege as a provider and be willing to be taught by their clients/patients.38

The starting point is not an examination of the client’s belief system, but rather requires the SUD counselor to
consider their own assumptions, biases, and beliefs. For example, counselors need to identify any implicit biases
they may have against people with problematic substance use or in recovery, as these biases can have a negative
effect on care and client rapport. If a particular therapeutic approach, such as medication-assisted treatment, is378 IC&RC Alcohol and Drug Counselor (ADC) Certification Examination Study Guide

He is wearing a dark, patterned shirt, possibly animal print. The background is softly blurred, suggesting an outdoor or well-lit indoor setting. The man on the left has his arm around the man on the right.]

not part of the counselor’s practice or their personal orientation regarding treatment, then the counselor should be conscious of any biases they may have toward individuals seeking or currently using medication for the treatment of SUD.

An awareness of the self is central to the notion of cultural humility. It means admitting that one does not know and is willing to learn from clients about their experiences, while being aware of one’s own culture(s). While competence suggests mastery, humility refers to an intrapersonal and interpersonal approach that cultivates person-centered care.

Thus, **cultural humility** refers to the counselor’s ability to maintain an interpersonal stance that is other-oriented (or open to the other) in relation to aspects of cultural identity that are most important to the client.³⁹ This encompasses the counselor’s openness to accepting that their own cultural identities and experiences will limit their perspective and awareness in understanding the cultural experiences of others. Specific attitudes and practices include openness, respect, consideration, humility, and interest regarding the client’s cultural identity and experiences.⁴⁰

In summary, counselors can develop cultural humility by:
» Practicing self-reflection, including awareness of their beliefs, values, and implicit biases
» Recognizing what they don’t know and being open to learning as much as they can
» Being open to other people’s identities and empathizing with their life experiences
» Acknowledging that the client is their own best authority
» Learning and growing from people whose beliefs, values, and worldviews differ from theirs⁴¹CHAPTER 9: Professional, Ethical and Legal Responsibilities 379

**Cultural competence** involves developing cultural knowledge, skills in understanding cross-cultural interactions, and an awareness and acceptance of the dynamic variety of people and populations. Cultural competence has been shown to improve an organization’s sustainability by reinforcing the value of diversity, flexibility, and responsiveness in addressing the current and changing needs of clients, communities, and the healthcare environment. SUD counselors play an important role in the engagement and retention of persons in services. They must have an increased understanding of how individual cultural differences affect substance use, mental health, and help-seeking behavior, and be adequately prepared to deliver effective behavioral health services to diverse individuals.

Counselors can improve their cultural competence and quality of care through:
» Increasing levels of personal awareness, knowledge, and skills
» Improving their capacity to work and communicate effectively in cross-cultural situations
» Learning about their own and others’ cultural identities
» Combating bias and stereotypes
» Respecting others’ beliefs, values, and communication preferences
» Adapting services to each patient’s unique needs
» Gaining new cultural experiences42

Cultural competence is a fundamental ingredient that helps to develop trust, as well as an understanding of the way members of different cultural groups define health, wellness, SUDs, and recovery. A culturally competent model of service provision also acknowledges the client’s cultural strengths, values, and experiences while encouraging behavioral and attitudinal change. Services that are culturally responsive are also characterized by:
» Staff knowledge of the native language of the client
» Staff sensitivity to the cultural nuances of the client population
» Staff backgrounds representative of those of the client population
» Service modalities that reflect the cultural values and treatment needs of the client population
» Representation of the client population in decision-making and policy implementation

The image is positioned on the right side of the page, next to the text about cultural competence.]

Organizations must continually grow their “cultural intelligence” to better understand and respond to the ever-changing needs of their clients and communities. Culturally competent systems include professional behavioral norms for both staff and the organization – norms that are built into the organization’s mission, structure, management, personnel, program design, and treatment protocols.[Layout: Single column of text with a header.

**A Word about Culture**

Culture influences many aspects of our lives from how we communicate and celebrate to how we perceive the world around us. Culture involves shared customs, values, social rules of behavior, rituals and traditions, and perceptions of human nature and natural events. Elements of culture are learned from others and may be passed down from generation to generation.

The importance of culture is heightened in the lives of those living in a socio-cultural setting other than the one into which they were born. For people living in their native culture, cultural issues might arise first when they have interactions with individuals who do not share the same culture of origin. These encounters prompt the realization that different cultures view the world in different ways. One way to bridge those differences is through the acquisition of knowledge about other cultures.

**RACE AND ETHNICITY**

Many people equate race and ethnicity with culture; however, the terms "race" and "ethnicity" do not fully define the scope and breadth of culture. Race and ethnicity are the most prominent elements of culture. There are important distinctions between these two terms. For example, many people think of **race** as a biological category based on parentage and associate it with visible physical characteristics such as hair and skin color. Physical features, however, do not reliably differentiate people of different races. For this reason, race is widely used as a social category. Different cultures classify people into racial groups based on a set of characteristics. Often, members of certain social or racial groups are treated as inferior or superior or given unequal access to power and other resources.43

**Ethnicity** refers to a common heritage of a particular group. Elements of this shared heritage include history, language, rituals, and preferences for music and foods. Ethnicity may overlap with race when race is defined as a social category. For example, because Hispanics are an ethnicity, not a race, within that culture, ethnic subgroups such as Cubans and Peruvians include people of different races.

**CONFIDENTIALITY AND INFORMED CONSENT**

Many chapters in this study guide have explored issues and laws related to confidentiality. This chapter looks more closely into the facets of informed consent and addresses confidentiality from the standpoint of the counselor’s ethical responsibility. Informed consent is the process by which clients are informed of their rights regarding treatment, as well as the benefits and risks of treatment. Informed consent is one of the most basic and important concepts in the delivery of ethical services because it establishes the client’s independence and right to self-determination in receiving services.45 In recent years, the concept of informed consent has broadened to include the idea of “person-centered or person-directed care.” This concept focuses on the assumption that the person has the right to choose or refuse treatment; it also defines the parameters of and sets goals for treatment/service outcomes.

**Elements of Informed Consent**

Informed consent is more than signing the right forms. Many states specify requirements for documentation of informed consent at specific points in the treatment process. Truly informed consent goes beyond the initial authorization for treatment and is an on-going collaborative effort between the client and the service team. Critical elements in achieving informed consent are the:

» client’s rational capacity to provide consent
» client’s comprehension of the information presented
» client’s sense of self-determination or voluntariness

A graduated consent process is preferred. Consent during a screening and assessment phase is conducted at that time to address confidentiality and other relevant issues when entry into treatment may be uncertain. At the point of entering treatment services, the standard treatment consent issues include (1) the clinical characteristics of the problem, including diagnosis; (2) treatment recommendations; (3) the risks and benefits of treatment; (4) the financial costs of the intervention; (5) alternative services or interventions should a client refuse the recommended form of care; and (6) freedom to choose or refuse treatment. In SUD treatment, the consent process might also change as clients move from detoxification to a longer-term residential treatment or when beginning intensive outpatient treatment after detoxification. An informed consent process for clients with SUDs means that treatment providers would talk with clients at each juncture in treatment when the focus or modality of treatment is likely to change. Although signatures might not be required at these transitions, clients should agree in principle with each change of focus or modality of care.46

Cultural and linguistic issues are an important, and often overlooked, aspect of obtaining informed consent. Lack of understanding of professional terminology, linguistic barriers, and poor literacy skills may inhibit a client’s true understanding of what is contained in the consent for treatment. Cultural values may also affect a client’s willingness to ask questions as part of the informed consent process. The counselor should make every effort to ensure that consent is truly voluntary and fully informed.

**Ensure Confidentiality of Client Information**

One of the highest legal and ethical charges in helping professions is maintaining client confidentiality. This includes protecting the client’s privacy and guarding information contained in the clinical or service record. Because of the stigma that is still associated with substance use (and mental health) conditions, maintaining privacy and confidentiality is a critical aspect of protecting the client’s welfare. SUD counselors are expected to protect client’s rights to privacy and confidentiality according to best practices when documenting and reviewing records, especially regarding the communication of client information with third parties. This places a[Layout: A single column of text. An image is located on the right side of the page, adjacent to the text. A header is at the top of the page.]

384 IC&RC Alcohol and Drug Counselor (ADC) Certification Examination Study Guide

responsibility on the counselor to ensure that
there is no unauthorized disclosure of client
information including family members and
other clients receiving services.

The assurance of confidentiality in behavioral
health is a fundamental guarantee, but it is
not an absolute one. There are many state and
federal laws that outline how service providers
must protect medical, mental health, and
substance use information. Laws also outline
circumstances when this protected health
information can be shared. Chapter 4 outlined
the requirements under the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996
(HIPAA), Public Law 104-191.

As a reminder of what has been previously
presented in this study guide, substance
use information has additional protections
and guidelines beyond those afforded to
physical health, and some circumstances
allow information regarding an individual’s
behavioral health to be shared without
consent.

[Image: A black and white photograph showing several pieces of paper or files. The topmost piece of paper has a large, rectangular, rubber-stamp style imprint that says "CONFIDENTIAL" in all capital letters. The image is positioned to the right of the main text body, partially overlapping the spiral binding of what appears to be a notebook.]

Confidentiality for substance use is considered
so vital that a federal law outlines the
provisions that must be followed. Chapter 42 C.F.R. §1, Part 2 was enacted in 1972 to specifically protect
information regarding substance use. Part 2 was last revised in 2020 to further facilitate better coordination of
care in response to the opioid epidemic while maintaining its confidentiality protections against unauthorized
disclosure and use. This regulation states that, in general, substance use information in clinical records shall
be confidential and may be disclosed only as authorized by law and regulations. Part 2 applies to clients in
any treatment modality or treatment setting, regardless of how treatment is being funded. There are several
summary and guidance documents published by the federal government that describe how this authority is to be
exercised in practice.⁴⁷, ⁴⁸

**Ethical Issues in Confidentiality**

Several ethical issues involving confidentiality frequently arise in the SUD treatment field. Since the laws
protecting clients are more stringent than laws regarding confidentiality of client records in other fields,
counselors must be specifically familiar with these requirements to avoid ethical confusion or dilemmas. Specific
areas of concern are described below.

**DUTY TO WARN/PROTECT**

Protecting public safety is generally viewed as an ethical responsibility for all counselors. Most people believe
that counselors have an obligation or **duty to warn** or protect people if they believe that their client is placing
those people in danger. In this circumstance, the right to confidential treatment must be weighed against
the need to ensure the safety of others. At the beginning of the counseling relationship, the client should be
informed about these limits of confidentiality, including steps that must be taken to protect the public, such
as policies about notification of law enforcement personnel if a habitual DUI offender drives to a counseling
appointment while intoxicated or an incident of child abuse is revealed.[Layout: The page has a header, a main text body on the left, and a sidebar on the right. The left side has a spiral binding visual effect.]

CHAPTER 9: Professional, Ethical and Legal Responsibilities
385

Duty to warn is more complicated by HIV-related confidentiality issues. Counselors have a duty to educate
clients about the health risks of their specific sex and drug practices without expressing moral judgment, and
to communicate any concerns that arise during treatment. In some circumstances, counselors may offer to help
communicate information to sexual partners of HIV-infected clients. States may have specific procedures for
confidentiality of HIV testing results and for handling records of HIV positive clients. Counselors should be aware
of these procedures so that they can inform their clients how HIV-related information will be handled.

**MINORS AND FAMILIES**

All states require counselors and other helping professionals to report situations that present an imminent risk
of harm to minors. Specific state statutes differ regarding who must make a report, the authority to whom the
report is to be made and the level of evidence required for making a report. Often, it is difficult to determine the
actual level of risk posed to a child. It is important to remember that the SUD counselor should not investigate
the child’s situation or determine how the situation should be handled. This is the responsibility of specially
trained child protective investigators.

In some circumstances, the question of risk to a child may not be clear and counselors must rely on their own
judgment about whether a report should be made. The client may describe difficult or unsafe circumstances,
but then deny that there is any danger to the child. When in doubt, a counselor should seek supervision or
consultation about whether a particular situation is a reportable incident or not. Consultation with another
professional in these situations is extremely valuable in helping a counselor fulfill their ethical responsibility.

Counselors who provide SUD treatment for minors must be clear about how much information will be provided to
parents of their clients. A young person may hesitate to be truthful with a counselor if confidentiality boundaries
are not clear. In the best of circumstances, the counselor will obtain the client’s consent to disclose important
information to the parents. The therapeutic alliance between counselor and client may be damaged if a counselor
who is unclear on the limits of confidentiality later provides information to parents. Counselors should be
familiar with federal laws on confidentiality of SUD abuse records for minor clients, as well as any applicable
state laws, and should seek professional consultation whenever questions arise.49

**Protect Client Rights**

Clients receiving SUD treatment and recovery support services have
specific rights that must be respected. It is the SUD counselor’s
responsibility to inform the client of these rights as well as to safeguard
these rights throughout the course of care. Counselors may need to
serve as an advocate for a client with various other service providers or
systems to ensure that these rights are protected. In some settings or
laws, such as within the criminal justice system, some of these rights are
abbreviated.

Client rights, also referred to as patient rights, are in federal and state
laws to honor and help protect the rights of individuals who have
health conditions that may include substance use and/or mental health
conditions. Diagnosable SUDs are considered disabilities under Section
504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act
(ADA), and Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act50 and are afforded all
protections and rights.

While language may not be exact in all instances, clients’ rights include
being treated with respect; being informed of treatment options;
receiving adequate care and services that meet their needs; refusing
or withdrawing consent for any treatment; being free from abuse and
protections and rights.

neglect; and respecting their privacy. Laws also include the rights to comprehensive health, social, educational,
and rehabilitative services without discrimination, and encourage and support self-determination in treatment
and recovery.

The example of client rights described below is common for clients/patients in all health care settings.⁵¹

**Right to Individual Dignity** – The premise of this right is that client/patient is entitled to a certain measure
of personal freedom and cannot be detained against their will (involuntarily) except for a crime or to protect
themselves or others from imminent risk of harm. In addition, clients/patients have a right to participate in the
formulation and review of their treatment plan; and a right to receive services in the least restrictive and most
appropriate setting based on their needs, best interests, and optimum chance for recovery.

**Right to Confidentiality** – The client/patient has a right to have information about their treatment protected as
private. This information may be released only under certain circumstances that include the following:
    »   With the written informed consent of the client/patient.
    »   In case of medical emergency to medical personnel.
    »   To service providers with a need to know.
    »   To the state authority for substance abuse or the Federal Department of Health and Human Services, for

    »   For audits or evaluations of the provider.
    »   For “good cause” court orders.
    »   For releasing information about crimes on the premises of the treatment program or against treatment
        provider personnel.
    »   For reporting of child abuse and neglect.
    »   By a minor for voluntary admissions and by a minor and guardian for involuntary admissions.

**Right to Information** – There are several areas related to information. The client/patient has the right to:
    »   Know who is providing medical services and is responsible for care.
    »   Know what client/patient support services are available, including if an interpreter is available if the
        person does not speak English.
    »   Know what rules and regulations apply to their conduct.
    »   Be given by the health care provider information such as diagnosis, planned course of treatment,
        alternatives, risks, and prognosis.
    »   Refuse any treatment, except as otherwise provided by law.
    »   Know the health care provider’s or health care facility’s procedures for expressing a grievance and be
        able to express grievances regarding any violation of their rights, as stated in law, through the grievance
        procedure of the health care provider or health care facility which served them and to the appropriate
        state licensing agency.

**Right to Financial Disclosure** – There are several areas related to financial information. The patient has the right
to:
    »   Be given, upon request, full information and necessary counseling on the availability of known financial
        resources for their care.
    »   Know, upon request and in advance of treatment, what type of funding the health care provider or health
        care facility accepts, such as Medicaid or Medicare (if the client/patient is eligible).
    »   Receive, upon request, prior to treatment, a reasonable estimate of charges for medical care.
    »   Receive a copy of a reasonably clear and understandable, itemized bill and, upon request, to have the
        charges explained.

**Right to Non-Discriminatory Services** – Civil rights protections under federal law and most state statutes
specify that an individual may not be denied access to services solely on race, gender, ethnicity, marital status or
disability. In publicly funded agencies, it is also generally a right to receive services regardless of ability to pay.CHAPTER 9: Professional, Ethical and Legal Responsibilities 387

**Right to Quality Services** – Quality services must be based on need (diagnostic and utilization criteria), individualized, administered safely and humanely, with full respect for dignity and integrity, and in accordance with statutory and regulatory requirements.

**Right to Communication** – The client/patient has the right to be told what is happening during the course of care and what decisions are being made on their behalf. In some instances (particularly for correctional programs) and with informed consent, this right may be limited by a provider to ensure a safe, drug-free environment (for example, phone, mail or visitation limitations in early days of treatment).

**Right to Personal Effects** – A provider may take temporary custody of a client’s belongings for safety or medical reasons, but possessions must be returned at the conclusion of treatment.

**Right of Minors to be Educated** – Persons under the age of 18 have the right to receive education based on their needs. This must be coordinated with the local school board. Parents and providers share the responsibility of providing this education.

**Right to Counsel** – For involuntary proceedings, all individuals, both minors and adults, have a right to counsel.

**Right to Habeas Corpus** – This means the right to “have the body” of evidence so that they may examine it and argue against it. In the case of involuntary commitment for evaluation and treatment, the right to habeas corpus means that the client/patient has the right to be told why and upon what evidence the court has decided to commit them against their will.

**COMPLAINTS AND GRIEVANCES**

People receiving services in behavioral health organizations have the right to file complaints and grievances with the organization when they are unsatisfied with the services received. Behavioral health organizations must have processes for addressing such client complaints and grievances to comply with federal and/or funder regulations, accreditation standards, protect persons served, and reduce liability.

Clients should be notified of their legal rights upon admission or as soon as possible after admission to care. They should be informed that they have the right to file complaints or grievances regarding their care; that their decision to file complaints or grievances will not compromise the care they will receive; and that all information will be kept confidential. In addition, clients should receive information regarding how to file a grievance or complaint and whom they should contact with such concerns. Some facilities have posted signs in common areas with the contact information of individual whom they can communicate in the event of a complaint or grievance.⁵²

A formal complaints management system encompasses the processes for collecting and analyzing complaints data, as well as how to act upon this information. Two issues are central for managing patient/client complaints. First, is the opportunity for clients to provide feedback on their experiences (e.g., the care they receive, staff expertise, etc.) and to complain when their experiences do not align with their expectations. The second issue surrounds the ability of the management system to adequately analyze, respond to, and use client feedback for service quality improvement.⁵³

**Complaints** stem from minor issues that can typically be resolved by staff present at the time the concern is voiced, while grievances are more serious and generally require investigation into allegations regarding the quality of care. A **grievance** is an expression of dissatisfaction with any aspect of the operations, services, or behavior of a service provider, regardless of whether remedial action is requested. Most grievance procedures require the client file the grievance either verbally or in writing within a specific time frame after the triggering event or incident precipitating the grievance. Examples of grievances include:
*   problems getting an appointment, or having to wait a long time for an appointment.
*   disrespectful or rude behavior by clinical or administrative staff.
*   disagreement with the course of care.

It is important to address both complaints and grievances in a timely and effective manner. The timeliness depends on the issue. For example, complaints can usually be resolved promptly or within 24 hours and involve staff who are present at the time of the complaint. Staff should always try to resolve client complaints or concerns immediately and informally whenever possible. Small issues can escalate if not addressed properly, and people (or their family members or representatives) who feel that their complaints have not been resolved or who have a more in-depth concern may file a formal grievance.⁵⁴ Some organizations have client advocates or representatives whose specific function is to facilitate the care process and help resolve problems the person might face.

Each organization will have specific directives for filing a complaint or grievance. It is the responsibility of the SUD counselor to be aware of these and understand how to guide the person receiving services as indicated in their organization’s policy. Most follow a process like the steps shown below:
*   Any concern, complaint or grievance is to be reported directly to a designated person/unit or made via phone or email.
*   The complaint and/or grievance will be acknowledged upon receipt by the designated person/unit in writing.
*   The details of the grievance will be communicated to supervisory level staff for review and investigation, and the designated person/unit will relay the findings and any follow-up information.
*   Timeframes are established to resolve the grievance with a set number of days, at which time the person will be provided with a written response of resolution of the grievance.
*   Upon completion of the investigative process, all involved parties will receive written notification of the findings and resolution.CHAPTER 9: Professional, Ethical and Legal Responsibilities 389

COUNSELOR RESPONSES TO A GRIEVANCE

When a counselor has a complaint or grievance filed against them related to their professional work or conduct, it is important for them to respond professionally and constructively. Here are some recommended steps:55

1.  **Stay Calm and Professional:** It’s crucial to approach the situation calmly and professionally, without letting emotions dictate the response.
2.  **Understand the Grievance:** Carefully review the details of the grievance. Understand the specific concerns or complaints raised by the client or party filing the grievance.
3.  **Consult Ethical Guidelines and Policies:** Counselors should refer to their professional code of ethics and the policies of their workplace or governing body. This helps in understanding the appropriate procedure for handling grievances.
4.  **Seek Legal or Supervisory Advice:** If necessary, consult with a legal advisor or a supervisor. This is especially important if the grievance has legal implications or could significantly impact the counselor’s professional standing. Understand the definitions of any legal terms used.
5.  **Prepare a Formal Response:** Draft a formal response to the grievance. This should be done in a manner that addresses the concerns raised, adheres to ethical standards, and respects client confidentiality.
6.  **Engage in Self-Reflection:** Reflect on the feedback and consider if there are areas of practice that could be improved. Self-reflection is key to professional growth and maintaining high standards of care.
7.  **Participate in Resolution Processes:** Engage in any formal processes required by the workplace or professional body to resolve the grievance. This might include meetings, mediation, or a formal hearing.
8.  **Maintain Documentation:** Keep detailed records of all communications and actions taken in response to the grievance. This documentation can be crucial for accountability and future reference.
9.  **Focus on Learning and Improvement:** Use the experience as a learning opportunity to enhance professional skills and prevent future grievances.
10. **Ensure Ongoing Professional Development:** Commit to ongoing education and training to continually improve counseling skills and stay updated with best practices.

It’s important to remember that grievances, while challenging, can provide valuable feedback and opportunities for professional growth. The key is to handle them with integrity, openness to learning, and a commitment to maintaining high standards of professional practice.[Layout: Single column text with a header and page number.

**SUMMARY**

This chapter highlights the interplay between legal requirements, ethical practice, and responsiveness to diverse clients as fundamental for professional integrity and effective client care. Counselors must be well-informed about the laws, regulations, and ethical codes that pertain to their practice, and they have the responsibility to address and rectify any ethical breaches they or their peers may commit. Ethical standards are in place to guide counselors on both prescribed and prohibited behaviors, as well as methods for ethical decision-making in daily practice. Ongoing professional development and appropriate supervision play critical roles in maintaining ethical standards.

It also is a part of the counselor’s professional ethics to advocate for and promote diversity, equity, and inclusion. SUD counselors must strive to be adept and sensitive to the diverse cultural backgrounds of their clients and understand how the different cultural groups define health, wellness, SUDs, and recovery. Both cultural humility and cultural competence are essential for ensuring that treatment approaches are inclusive and respectful of all clients, regardless of their background. By embracing these concepts, SUD counselors can enhance their effectiveness, facilitate better client outcomes, and foster an environment where all clients feel understood and valued.[Layout: Two columns with a header.
