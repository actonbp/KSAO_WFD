**MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS**

Mental health disorders encompass a wide range of conditions that affect mood, thinking, behavior, and
perception. These disorders can significantly impact a person’s ability to function in daily life, influencing
relationships, work, and overall well-being. From common disorders like anxiety and depression to more
complex conditions like schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders, each mental health issue presents unique
challenges. Understanding the signs, symptoms, and treatments associated with each disorder is crucial for
effective management and care.

Mental health disorders are largely a result of problems or mistakes in how the brain functions in individuals
and what is happening in their brain chemistry. Mental health disorders can be very mild and have very little
impact on the person’s life, or they can be very severe, causing the person with the disorder to become disabled
and unable to carry on with their normal activities. How mental health disorders show up in individuals is
different for children than it is for adults; different for males and females; and can be different for different races
and different cultures.

Specific symptoms define mental health disorders and help lead to a correct diagnosis. The symptoms can
vary from person to person, even if the diagnosis is the same. People may have high anxiety, have problems
in thinking clearly, have distorted perceptions of the world around them, or have problems controlling their
behavior. Making a proper diagnosis of the type of mental health disorder a person is experiencing is very
important because it helps to determine what type of treatment the person will need.

Medications can play an important role in treating mental health disorders. They are often used in combination
with other treatments, such as psychotherapy and brain stimulation therapy. Medications can affect people in
different ways, and it may take several tries to find the medication that works best with the fewest side effects.
It’s important to work with a health care provider or a mental health professional to develop a treatment plan
that meets a client’s individual needs and medical situation.

Information about medications is updated frequently. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has
Medication Guides with the latest information, warnings, and approved medications. MedlinePlus also provides
information on drugs, herbs, and supplements, including side effects and warnings. In addition, the National
Institute on Mental Health (NIMH) maintains an entire section of their website on mental health disorders and
medications used for treatment.

This appendix provides an overview of the most diagnosed mental health disorders, offering insights into their
characteristics and the types of medications used to address them.

**Anxiety Disorders**

Anxiety disorders are a group of mental health conditions that cause excessive fear or anxiety. Unlike the
relatively mild and brief anxiety caused by a stressful event (such as speaking in public or a first date), anxiety
disorders last at least six months and can worsen if not treated. They often affect daily functioning, making it
hard to complete tasks at work, school, or in social settings due to persistent worry or fear. These disorders are
among the most common mental health conditions worldwide and can vary greatly in severity.

**Signs and Symptoms**

Common symptoms of anxiety disorders include:
» Feelings of nervousness, restlessness, or being tense
» A sense of impending danger, panic, or doom
» Increased heart rate
» Rapid breathing, or hyperventilation
» Sweating
» Trembling
» Feeling weak or tired
» Difficulty concentrating or thinking about anything other than the present worry
» Having trouble sleeping
» Experiencing gastrointestinal (GI) problems

**Sub-types of the Disorder**

There are several major types of anxiety disorders, each with its own characteristics:
» **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD):** Characterized by chronic anxiety, exaggerated worry, and tension,
even when there is little or nothing to provoke it.
» **Panic Disorder:** Involves recurrent, unexpected panic attacks and fear of experiencing another episode.
» **Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia):** Involves overwhelming worry and self-consciousness about
everyday social situations.
» **Specific Phobias:** An intense fear of a specific object or situation, such as heights or flying.
» **Agoraphobia:** Fear of being in situations where escape might be difficult or that help wouldn't be
available if things go wrong.
» **Separation Anxiety Disorder:** Fear of being away from home or loved ones.

**Medications Used to Treat the Disorder**

Medications are often used in conjunction with therapy to treat anxiety disorders. Common types of medication
include:
» **Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs):** Often the first line of medication prescribed for anxiety,
SSRIs like fluoxetine and sertraline can help reduce symptoms of anxiety.
» **Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs):** Medications such as venlafaxine and duloxetine
are also effective in treating anxiety by increasing levels of serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain.
» **Benzodiazepines:** These drugs can help relieve anxiety symptoms quickly but are generally used for
short-term relief due to the risk of dependency.

These medications can be very effective but often come with side effects and risks, so it's important for
individuals to work closely with their healthcare provider to find the most appropriate treatment for their
specific needs.

APPENDICES 417

**Mood Disorders**

Mood disorders are a category of mental health conditions characterized by significant changes in mood that disrupt daily life. These changes can manifest as periods of intense sadness or excessively high and euphoric moods, or sometimes both, affecting a person's ability to function. Mood disorders not only affect emotions but also energy levels, sleep patterns, appetite, and overall health. The two primary types of mood disorders are depressive disorders and bipolar disorders, each involving different types of mood disturbances.

**DEPRESSIVE DISORDERS**

Depressive disorders are a category of mood disorders that involve persistent feelings of sadness and a lack of interest in external activities. They can significantly impair daily functioning. Unlike normal emotional experiences of sadness, grief, or low energy, depressive disorders are persistent and can dramatically interfere with a person's ability to function. People with depressive disorders might struggle with their daily work, sleep, eating, and enjoyment of life. These disorders might occur only once in a lifetime but more commonly occur repeatedly.

**Signs and Symptoms**

Symptoms of depressive disorders can include:
» Persistent feelings of sadness, anxiety, or emptiness
» Feelings of hopelessness or pessimism
» Irritability
» Feelings of guilt, worthlessness, or helplessness
» Loss of interest or pleasure in hobbies and activities
» Decreased energy or fatigue
» Moving or talking more slowly
» Difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions
» Trouble sleeping, early-morning awakening, or oversleeping
» Appetite and/or weight changes
» Thoughts of death or suicide, or suicide attempts
» Aches or pains, headaches, cramps, or digestive problems without a clear physical cause and/or that do not ease even with treatment

**Sub-types of the Disorder**

Several types of depressive disorders commonly recognized include:
» **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD):** Characterized by severe depressive symptoms that interfere with a person's ability to work, sleep, study, eat, and enjoy life. An episode can occur only once in a person's lifetime, but more often, a person has several episodes.
» **Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia):** A chronic form of depression where a person's mood is regularly low. However, symptoms are not as severe as in major depression.
» **Postpartum Depression:** Not just the typical “baby blues,” this includes extreme feelings of sadness, anxiety, and exhaustion that can interfere with a new mother's ability to care for herself or her family.
» **Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD):** A type of depression that's related to changes in seasons, typically starting in the late fall and early winter and going away during the spring and summer.
» **Bipolar Disorder:** Although not strictly classified as a depressive disorder, it involves significant mood episodes, ranging from extremes of high energy with an “up” mood (mania) to low depressive periods.

418 IC&RC Alcohol and Drug Counselor (ADC) Certification Examination Study Guide

**Medications Used to Treat the Disorder**

Treatment for depressive disorders often involves medications, including:
» **Antidepressants**: Medications that are commonly used to treat depressive disorders include SSRIs
   (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline), SNRIs (e.g., venlafaxine, duloxetine), and other groups like tricyclic
   antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).
» **Mood Stabilizers**: Particularly useful in bipolar disorder, such as lithium and certain anticonvulsants.
» **Atypical Antipsychotics**: Sometimes used in conjunction with antidepressants for major depressive
   disorder or bipolar disorder.

Depression, even the most severe cases, can be treated. The earlier treatment begins, the more effective it is.
Depression is usually treated with psychotherapy, medication, or a combination of the two. Various medications
work differently and can be highly effective when closely monitored by a healthcare provider to manage potential
side effects and ensure the best treatment response. Some people experience treatment-resistant depression,
which occurs when a person does not get better after trying at least two antidepressant medications. In this case
or the need for rapid relief from symptoms is urgent, brain stimulation therapy may be an option to explore.

**BIPOLAR DISORDER**

Bipolar disorder, also known as bipolar affective disorder, involves significant changes in mood, energy, and
activity levels that can affect a person’s ability to carry out day-to-day tasks. These changes range from periods
of extremely “up” and energized behavior (known as manic episodes) to very sad, “down,” or hopeless periods
(known as depressive episodes). Less severe manic periods are known as hypomanic episodes. Bipolar disorder is
a lifelong condition that can be managed with proper treatment.

**Signs and Symptoms**

The symptoms of bipolar disorder vary between two main mood episodes: manic and depressive.

**Manic symptoms include:**
» Feeling very “up,” “high,” or elated
» Having a lot of energy
» Increased activity levels
» Feeling “jumpy” or “wired”
» Having trouble sleeping
» Becoming more active than usual
» Talking very fast about a lot of different things
» Being agitated, irritable, or “touchy”
» Feeling like thoughts are racing
» Engaging in risky behavior, such as spending a lot of money or reckless driving

**Depressive symptoms include:**
» Feeling very sad, down, empty, or hopeless
» Having very little energy
» Decreased activity levels
» Trouble sleeping, either too much or too little
» Feeling like they can’t enjoy anything
» Feeling worried and empty
» Trouble concentrating
» Forgetting lots of things
» Eating too much or too little
» Thoughts of death or suicide

APPENDICES 419

**Sub-types of the Disorder**

Bipolar disorder is divided into several subtypes, each defined by the pattern of mood episodes:

» **Bipolar I Disorder:** Defined by manic episodes that last at least 7 days, or by manic symptoms that are so severe that immediate hospital care is needed. Usually, depressive episodes occur as well, typically lasting at least 2 weeks.
» **Bipolar II Disorder:** Defined by a pattern of depressive episodes and hypomanic episodes, but not the full-blown manic episodes that are typical of Bipolar I Disorder.
» **Cyclothymic Disorder (Cyclothymia):** Defined by periods of hypomanic symptoms as well as periods of depressive symptoms lasting for at least 2 years (1 year in children and adolescents); however, the symptoms do not meet the diagnostic requirements for a hypomanic episode and a depressive episode.

**Medications Used to Treat the Disorder**

Effective treatment for bipolar disorder usually includes a combination of medication and psychotherapy. Common medications used include:

» **Mood Stabilizers:** Such as lithium, which is effective in controlling manic episodes and preventing the recurrence of both manic and depressive episodes.
» **Anticonvulsants:** Such as valproate, lamotrigine, or carbamazepine, which serve as mood stabilizers to treat or prevent manic episodes.
» **Atypical Antipsychotics:** These are often used in the treatment of bipolar disorder to help control manic or mixed episodes. Examples include olanzapine, aripiprazole, and quetiapine.
» **Antidepressants:** Sometimes used to manage depressive episodes in bipolar disorder, but typically in combination with a mood stabilizer to prevent triggering a manic episode.

Managing bipolar disorder effectively requires careful monitoring and cooperation between the patient and their healthcare provider to optimize treatment and minimize the risk of mood swings and other side effects.

**Personality Disorders**

Personality disorders are a group of mental health conditions characterized by inflexible and unhealthy patterns of thinking, feeling, and behaving. These inner experiences and behaviors often differ significantly from what is expected in the cultures in which they occur. The rigid and potentially self-destructive or damaging patterns of thoughts and behaviors typically become evident during adolescence or early adulthood and can cause distress or impairment in personal, social, and work situations.

**Signs and Symptoms**

The symptoms vary widely depending on the specific type of personality disorder but generally include:

» Trouble perceiving and relating to situations and people, including excessive attachment to or dependency on others
» Problems with emotional regulation and impulse control
» Inflexible thinking patterns and behavior
» Social inhibition or withdrawal
» Hostility, stubbornness, or a persistent disregard for others’ feelings

**Sub-types of the Disorder**

Personality disorders are classified into three clusters based on descriptive similarities:

**Cluster A (Odd, eccentric thinking or behavior):**

» **Paranoid Personality Disorder:** Distrust and suspicion of others, believing that others are out to harm them.
» **Schizoid Personality Disorder:** Detachment from social relationships and a limited range of emotional expression.

420 IC&RC Alcohol and Drug Counselor (ADC) Certification Examination Study Guide

» **Schizotypal Personality Disorder**: Acute discomfort in close relationships, cognitive or perceptual distortions, and eccentricities of behavior.

**Cluster B (Dramatic, overly emotional, or unpredictable thinking or behavior):**
» **Antisocial Personality Disorder**: Disregard for and violation of the rights of others, lack of empathy.
» **Borderline Personality Disorder**: Instability in personal relationships, self-image, and affects, and marked impulsivity.
» **Histrionic Personality Disorder**: Excessive emotionality and attention seeking.
» **Narcissistic Personality Disorder**: Grandiosity, need for admiration, and a lack of empathy.

**Cluster C (Anxious, fearful thinking or behavior):**
» **Avoidant Personality Disorder**: Social inhibition, feelings of inadequacy, and extreme sensitivity to criticism.
» **Dependent Personality Disorder**: Excessive need to be taken care of, leading to submissive and clinging behavior and fears of separation.
» **Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder** (not to be confused with obsessive-compulsive disorder): Preoccupation with orderliness, perfectionism, and control.

**Medications Used to Treat the Disorder**

Medications are not typically used as the primary treatment for personality disorders but may be prescribed to help with specific troubling and debilitating symptoms. For instance:
» **Antidepressants** may be used to treat symptoms of depression, anger, or irritability, which can occur with many personality disorders.
» **Mood Stabilizers** can help flatten mood swings or reduce irritability, impulsivity, and aggression.
» **Antipsychotic Medications** may be helpful for those with symptoms that include loss of touch with reality (psychosis), such as occurs in schizotypal personality disorder.
» **Anti-anxiety Medications** can help relieve the anxiety, agitation, and insomnia that often accompany these disorders.

Treatment for personality disorders typically involves long-term psychotherapy with a psychologist or psychiatrist and, sometimes, medications to treat distressing symptoms associated with the disorder or co-occurring problems, such as depression or anxiety.

**Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)**

Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a chronic mental health condition characterized by uncontrollable, recurring thoughts (obsessions) and behaviors (compulsions) that the individual feels the urge to repeat over and over. These obsessions and compulsions interfere with daily activities and cause significant distress. The person may try to ignore or stop the obsessions, but this only increases their distress and anxiety, leading them to perform ritualistic behaviors to reduce the anxiety.

**Signs and Symptoms**

Symptoms of OCD can vary but generally include both obsessions and compulsions.

**Obsessions are repeated thoughts, urges, or mental images that cause anxiety. Common symptoms include:**
» Fear of germs or contamination
» Unwanted forbidden or taboo thoughts involving sex, religion, or harm
» Aggressive thoughts towards others or self
» Having things symmetrical or in a perfect order

APPENDICES 421

**Compulsions are repetitive behaviors that a person with OCD feels the urge to do in response to an obsessive thought. Common compulsions include:**
» Excessive cleaning and/or handwashing
» Ordering and arranging things in a particular, precise way
» Repeatedly checking on things, such as repeatedly checking to see if the door is locked
» Compulsive counting

**Sub-types of the Disorder**

While OCD is generally considered a single disorder, it can manifest in various forms, depending on the nature of the obsessions and compulsions. Some sub-types include:
» **Contamination Obsessions with Cleaning Compulsions:** Fear of contamination leads to excessive cleaning rituals.
» **Symmetry Obsessions with Ordering/Arranging Compulsions:** Need for things to be symmetrical or in perfect order, leading to arranging rituals.
» **Harm Obsessions with Checking Compulsions:** Fear that failure to check things will lead to harm or disaster.
» **Forbidden Thoughts Obsessions with Related Compulsions:** Involves obsessions with aggressive, sexual, or religious thoughts and related compulsive behaviors to neutralize these thoughts.

**Medications Used to Treat the Disorder**

Treatment often includes a combination of medication and psychotherapy. Common medications used are:
» **Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs):** These are the medications most commonly used to manage OCD. They may help reduce obsessions and compulsions. Examples include fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and sertraline.
» **Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs):** In some cases, particularly when SSRIs are ineffective, TCAs like clomipramine may be prescribed. Clomipramine is specifically approved for treating OCD and is often considered particularly effective, though it may have more side effects than SSRIs.

Psychotherapy, especially cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and specifically Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP), is considered the most effective means of reducing compulsive behaviors. This involves gradual exposure to the source of the individual's obsession and learning to refrain from compulsive behavior intended to reduce anxiety.

**Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)**

Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition triggered by experiencing or witnessing a terrifying event. Symptoms may include flashbacks, nightmares, severe anxiety, and uncontrollable thoughts about the event. Many people who go through traumatic events may have temporary difficulty adjusting and coping, but with time and good self-care, they usually get better. However, if the symptoms worsen, last for months or even years, and interfere with day-to-day functioning, they may have PTSD. Getting effective treatment after PTSD symptoms develop can be critical in reducing symptoms and improving function.

**Signs and Symptoms**

Symptoms of PTSD are generally grouped into four types:

» **Intrusive memories,** which may include:
    › Recurrent, unwanted distressing memories of the traumatic event
    › Reliving the traumatic event as if it were happening again (flashbacks)
    › Upsetting dreams or nightmares about the traumatic event
    › Severe emotional distress or physical reactions to something that reminds you of the traumatic event

422 IC&RC Alcohol and Drug Counselor (ADC) Certification Examination Study Guide

» **Avoidance**, which may involve:
    › Trying to avoid thinking or talking about the traumatic event
    › Avoiding places, activities, or people that remind you of the traumatic event

» **Negative changes in thinking and mood**, such as:
    › Negative feelings about yourself or other people
    › Inability to experience positive emotions
    › Feeling emotionally numb
    › Lack of interest in activities you once enjoyed
    › Hopelessness about the future
    › Memory problems, including not remembering important aspects of the traumatic event
    › Difficulty maintaining close relationships

» **Changes in physical and emotional reactions** (also called arousal symptoms), which may include:
    › Being easily startled or frightened
    › Always being on guard for danger
    › Self-destructive behavior, such as drinking too much or driving too fast
    › Trouble sleeping
    › Trouble concentrating
    › Irritability, angry outbursts, or aggressive behavior
    › Overwhelming feelings of guilt or shame

**Sub-types of the Disorder**

While PTSD is generally considered as a single disorder, it can manifest in different forms, depending on the
intensity, duration, and nature of the symptoms:

» **Acute Stress Disorder (ASD)**: Occurs immediately after the traumatic event, lasting from three days to
one month.
» **Complex PTSD**: Seen in individuals who have experienced prolonged or repeated trauma, such as
domestic violence, abuse, or war.

**Medications Used to Treat the Disorder**

Medications are often used in combination with psychotherapy to treat PTSD. The most common types of
medications prescribed include:

» **Antidepressants**: Particularly SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) like sertraline and
paroxetine, which can help alleviate symptoms of depression and anxiety.
» **Prazosin**: If symptoms include insomnia or recurrent nightmares, this medication might be helpful.
» **Anti-anxiety medications**: Occasionally used to relieve severe anxiety and related problems, though
typically for short-term relief due to the risk of dependency.

Psychotherapy is a core component of treatment for PTSD. Effective modalities include cognitive-behavioral
therapy (CBT), which involves exposure therapy to help people face and control their fear by gradually exposing
them to the trauma they experienced in a safe way, and Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing
(EMDR), which involves processing distressing memories and changing the negative reactions to them.

**Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD)**

Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD) is a relatively new classification of mood disorder defined
to address the symptoms of chronic, severe and persistent irritability in children that does not fit the criteria
for bipolar disorder. DMDD is characterized by extreme difficulty in regulating emotions, which manifests as
intense temper outbursts at an intensity or duration that is disproportionate to the situation or provocation.
These outbursts can occur three or more times a week and are combined with a persistently irritable or angry
mood almost every day. This condition is typically diagnosed in children between the ages of 6 and 18.

APPENDICES 423

**Signs and Symptoms**

The main signs of DMDD include:
» Severe temper outbursts (verbal or behavioral) that are grossly out of proportion in intensity or duration
to the situation.
» Outbursts are inconsistent with the developmental level of the child.
» Mood between outbursts is persistently irritable or angry most of the day, nearly every day, and
observable by others in the child’s environments (like at home, at school, or with peers).
» Symptoms must be present for 12 or more months to be officially diagnosed as DMDD.

**Sub-types of the Disorder**

DMDD is not currently classified into sub-types but is distinguished by the pattern and frequency of outbursts
and the baseline mood state.

**Medications Used to Treat the Disorder**

The treatment for DMDD often involves a combination of medication and psychotherapy to help manage
symptoms and improve behavior. Commonly prescribed medications include:
» **Antidepressants**: SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors) may be used to help stabilize mood
swings and reduce irritability and depressive symptoms.
» **Psychostimulants**: These are often used if there is a co-existing attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD).
» **Antipsychotic Medications**: In some cases, these may be prescribed to help reduce the severity of temper
outbursts.

Psychotherapy, particularly Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), is also a crucial part of treatment and usually
focuses on helping the child develop more effective ways to manage their emotions and to react to upsetting
situations appropriately. Family therapy may also be recommended to help improve family interactions and to
educate family members about the disorder, enabling them to better support the child.

**Eating Disorders**

Eating disorders are serious and often fatal illnesses that are associated with severe disturbances in people’s
eating behaviors and related thoughts and emotions. Preoccupation with food, body weight, and shape may also
signal an eating disorder. Common eating disorders include anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating
disorder. These disorders can significantly impact physical health and may interfere with daily life activities.

**Signs and Symptoms**

Common signs and symptoms across different eating disorders include:
» Extreme concern with body weight and shape
» Abnormal eating habits such as severely restricting food intake or eating very large amounts
» Emotional distress or extreme concern about body weight or shape
» In more severe cases, eating disorders can cause serious health consequences and may even result in
death if not treated.

**Sub-types of the Disorder**

Eating disorders can be categorized into several distinct types, each with unique signs and symptoms:
» **Anorexia Nervosa**: Characterized by weight loss (or lack of appropriate weight gain in growing children);
difficulties maintaining an appropriate body weight for height, age, and stature; and, in many individuals,
distorted body image. People with anorexia generally restrict the number of calories and the types of food
they eat.
» **Bulimia Nervosa**: Involves periods of eating unusually large amounts of food followed by behaviors to
prevent weight gain, such as forced vomiting, excessive use of laxatives or diuretics, fasting, excessive

424 IC&RC Alcohol and Drug Counselor (ADC) Certification Examination Study Guide

exercise, or a combination of these behaviors.
» **Binge-Eating Disorder:** Similar to bulimia nervosa, but without regular use of purging, fasting, or excessive exercise. Individuals with binge-eating disorder are often overweight or obese.

**Medications Used to Treat the Disorder**

Medications are not the sole treatment for eating disorders as these conditions often require a comprehensive treatment plan including nutrition, education, psychotherapy, and medical and psychiatric monitoring. Commonly used medications include:
» **Antidepressants**: Often prescribed to help with symptoms of anxiety and depression that frequently co-occur with eating disorders. SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) are most commonly used.
» **Antipsychotics**: May be used, especially in severe cases of anorexia, to treat distorted thinking and reduce obsessive behaviors.
» **Mood Stabilizers**: Used in some cases to stabilize mood swings associated with eating disorders.

Comprehensive treatment aims to restore adequate nutrition, bring weight to a healthy level, reduce excessive exercise, and treat the psychological issues related to the eating disorder. This often involves a team approach, including primary care doctors, mental health professionals, and dietitians, all with experience in eating disorders.

**Schizophrenia**

Schizophrenia is a chronic and severe mental disorder that affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves. People with schizophrenia may seem like they have lost touch with reality, which can be distressing for them and for those around them. The disorder is characterized by episodes of psychosis, involving delusions and hallucinations, and periods of reduced engagement with the external world. Schizophrenia is not as common as other mental disorders, but the symptoms can be very disabling.

**Signs and Symptoms**

The symptoms of schizophrenia are generally divided into three categories: positive, negative, and cognitive.

**Positive symptoms** (added experiences):
» Hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that are not there)
» Delusions (false beliefs not based in reality)
» Thought disorders (unusual or dysfunctional ways of thinking)
» Movement disorders (agitated body movements)

**Negative symptoms** (capabilities that are reduced):
» Reduced expression of emotions in the face and voice
» Reduced feelings of pleasure in everyday life
» Difficulty beginning and sustaining activities
» Reduced speaking

**Cognitive symptoms** (affecting memory and other aspects of thinking):
» Poor executive functioning (the ability to understand information and use it to make decisions)
» Trouble focusing or paying attention
» Problems with working memory (the ability to use information immediately after learning it)

**Sub-types of the Disorder**

426 IC&RC Alcohol and Drug Counselor (ADC) Certification Examination Study Guide

» Often blurts out an answer before a question has been completed
» Often has trouble waiting their turn
» Often interrupts or intrudes on others (e.g., butts into conversations or games)

**Sub-types of the Disorder**

ADHD is typically categorized into three subtypes, which are:
» **Predominantly Inattentive Presentation:** The individual mainly has symptoms of inattention and is easily distracted but doesn’t really have issues with hyperactivity.
» **Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Presentation:** The individual mainly shows hyperactive and impulsive behaviors, including restlessness and difficulty waiting their turn.
» **Combined Presentation:** Symptoms of both inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity are equally present in the person.

**Medications Used to Treat the Disorder**

Treatment for ADHD typically involves medications, education or training, therapy, or a combination of treatments. The medications commonly used include:
» **Stimulants:** The most common type of medication used for treating ADHD. These drugs help control impulsive behavior and increase attention span. Examples include methylphenidate and amphetamines.
» **Non-stimulants:** Used for individuals who do not respond well to stimulants. They may take longer to start working than stimulants, but they can also improve focus, attention, and impulsivity in a person with ADHD. An example is atomoxetine.
» **Antidepressants:** Occasionally used for treating ADHD, particularly in individuals with co-occurring depression or anxiety.

Behavioral therapy, including psychoeducation, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and social skills training, plays a key role in treating ADHD, especially in children, to help improve behavior, self-control, and self-esteem.

**Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD)**

Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) encompass a range of neurodevelopmental conditions characterized by challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviors, speech, and nonverbal communication. The effects of ASD and the severity of symptoms are different in each person. ASD is known as a "spectrum" disorder because there is wide variation in the type and severity of symptoms people experience. ASD is typically evident by the age of two or three and can be diagnosed as early as 18 months or younger. Early intervention and support can significantly improve a child's development.

**Signs and Symptoms**

Common signs and symptoms of autism spectrum disorders include:
» Difficulties in social interaction, such as difficulty understanding and maintaining relationships
» Challenges with communication, including delays in language development or non-verbal communication behaviors like eye contact and facial expressions
» Repetitive behaviors or strict adherence to specific routines or behaviors
» Hyper- or hypo-reactivity to sensory input (e.g., adverse reactions to certain sounds, textures, or lights and fascination with lights or spinning objects)
» Unusual focus on pieces of toys (e.g., wheels of a toy car) rather than the whole toy

**Sub-types of the Disorder**

Previously, ASD included several distinct disorders, such as autistic disorder, pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), and Asperger syndrome. With the latest edition of the *Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5-TR)*, these subtypes have been merged into one umbrella diagnosis of ASD.

**Medications Used to Treat the Disorder**

APPENDICES 427

There are no medications that can cure ASD or treat the core symptoms. However, certain medications can help manage specific symptoms such as irritability, aggression, repetitive behavior, hyperactivity, anxiety, and attention problems. Common medications include:
» **Antipsychotics**: Such as risperidone and aripiprazole, which are the only FDA-approved medications for children with autism to help reduce irritability and aggression.
» **Stimulants and Non-stimulants**: Used to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms, which are common in individuals with ASD.
» **Antidepressants**: Sometimes prescribed to manage symptoms of anxiety and depression that can co-occur with autism.

Alongside medication, behavioral therapies and interventions are central to managing ASD. These can include behavioral therapy, speech and language therapy, and occupational therapy, which help improve communication, social skills, and physical coordination. Early, intensive, and individualized treatment has been shown to be effective in enhancing the functional abilities of children with ASD.

**Note: Substance Use Disorders** also belongs on this list. It is not listed since the other chapters in this study guide have SUDs as the focus.

**APPENDIX D:**
**SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF**
**PROBLEMATIC SUBSTANCE USE**

The signs and symptoms of problematic substance use can vary between adults and adolescents, reflecting
differences in ages, behaviors, responsibilities, and social environments.

**For Adults (indicators of problematic use)**

**1. Behavioral Changes:**
    >   Engaging in secretive or suspicious behaviors
    >   Hiding the substance use or the effect it is having from others
    >   Neglecting responsibilities at work, home, or school
    >   Deteriorating relationships with family, friends, coworkers, etc. or abrupt changes in relationships or
        social networks

    >   Appearing fearful, anxious, or paranoid, with no reason
    >   Lack of motivation; appearing tired or “spaced out”
    >   Periods of unusual increased energy, nervousness, or instability
    >   Unexplained change in personality or attitude

**4. Financial Issues:**
    >   Unexplained financial problems
    >   Borrowing or stealing money

**5. Escalating Behavior and Issues as a Result of Substance Use**

    >   Using drugs under dangerous conditions (driving while using drugs, using dirty needles, having
        unprotected sex)
    >   Increased drug tolerance (the need to use more of the drug to experience the same effects one used to
        achieve with smaller amounts)

430 IC&RC Alcohol and Drug Counselor (ADC) Certification Examination Study Guide

6. **Continued use despite having persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of the substance**: Relationships suffer but the use continues.

7. **Important social, occupational, or recreational activities given up or reduced because of substance use**: The individual stops or reduces participation in important activities due to their substance use.

8. **Recurrent substance use in situations in which it is physically hazardous**: The individual uses the substance in situations where it is physically unsafe.

9. **Use continues despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or exacerbated by the substance**: Despite knowing the harmful effects of the substance, use continues.

10. **Tolerance, as defined by either of the following**:
    a. A need for markedly increased amounts of the substance to achieve intoxication or desired effect.
    b. A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of the substance.

11. **Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following**:
    a. The characteristic withdrawal syndrome for the substance.
    b. The same (or a closely related) substance is taken to relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms.

These criteria help professionals determine the severity of the substance use disorder, which can range from mild to severe depending on how many criteria are met. Recognizing these signs can lead to earlier intervention and treatment, which can significantly improve outcomes.

Anyone meeting any two of the 11 criteria during the same 12-month period would receive a diagnosis of a SUD. The severity of the substance use disorder is then determined based on the number of criteria met:
    » **Mild**: 2-3 criteria **Moderate**: 4-5 criteria **Severe**: 6 or more criteria

**APPENDIX E:**
**NIDA PRINCIPLES OF**
**DRUG ADDICTION TREATMENT**

Extracted from *Principles of Drug Addiction Treatment: A Research-Based Guide (Third Edition)*, Revised
January 2018

**Principles of Effective Treatment**

1.  Addiction is a complex but treatable disease that affects brain function and behavior. Drugs of abuse alter the brain’s structure and function, resulting in changes that persist long after drug use has ceased. This may explain why drug abusers are at risk for relapse even after long periods of abstinence and despite the potentially devastating consequences.

2.  No single treatment is appropriate for everyone. Treatment varies depending on the type of drug and the characteristics of the patients. Matching treatment settings, interventions, and services to an individual’s particular problems and needs is critical to his or her ultimate success in returning to productive functioning in the family, workplace, and society.

3.  Treatment needs to be readily available. Because drug-addicted individuals may be uncertain about entering treatment, taking advantage of available services the moment people are ready for treatment is critical. Potential patients can be lost if treatment is not immediately available or readily accessible. As with other chronic diseases, the earlier treatment is offered in the disease process, the greater the likelihood of positive outcomes.

4.  Effective treatment attends to multiple needs of the individual, not just his or her drug abuse. To be effective, treatment must address the individual’s drug abuse and any associated medical, psychological, social, vocational, and legal problems. It is also important that treatment be appropriate to the individual’s age, gender, ethnicity, and culture.

5.  Remaining in treatment for an adequate period of time is critical. The appropriate duration for an individual depends on the type and degree of the patient’s problems and needs. Research indicates that most addicted individuals need at least 3 months in treatment to significantly reduce or stop their drug use and that the best outcomes occur with longer durations of treatment. Recovery from drug addiction is a long-term process and frequently requires multiple episodes of treatment. As with other chronic illnesses, relapses to drug abuse can occur and should signal a need for treatment to be reinstated or adjusted. Because individuals often leave treatment prematurely, programs should include strategies to engage and keep patients in treatment.

6.  Behavioral therapies—including individual, family, or group counseling—are the most commonly used forms of drug abuse treatment. Behavioral therapies vary in their focus and may involve addressing a patient’s motivation to change, providing incentives for abstinence, building skills to resist drug use, replacing drug-using activities with constructive and rewarding activities, improving problem-solving skills, and facilitating better interpersonal relationships. Also, participation in group therapy and other peer support programs during and following treatment can help maintain abstinence.

7.  Medications are an important element of treatment for many patients, especially when combined with counseling and other behavioral therapies. For example, methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone (including a new long-acting formulation) are effective in helping individuals addicted to heroin or other opioids stabilize their lives and reduce their illicit drug use. Acamprosate, disulfiram, and naltrexone are medications approved for treating alcohol dependence. For persons addicted to nicotine, a nicotine replacement product (available as patches, gum, lozenges, or nasal spray) or an oral medication (such

432 IC&RC Alcohol and Drug Counselor (ADC) Certification Examination Study Guide

as bupropion or varenicline) can be an effective component of treatment when part of a comprehensive
behavioral treatment program.

8. An individual's treatment and services plan must be assessed continually and modified as necessary to
ensure that it meets his or her changing needs. A patient may require varying combinations of services
and treatment components during the course of treatment. and recovery. In addition to counseling or
psychotherapy, a patient may require medication, medical services, family therapy, parenting instruction,
vocational rehabilitation, and/or social and legal services. For many patients, a continuing care approach
provides the best results, with the treatment intensity varying according to a person's changing needs.

9. Many drug-addicted individuals also have other mental disorders. Because drug abuse and addiction—
both of which are mental disorders—often co-occur with other mental illnesses, patients presenting with
one condition should be assessed for the other(s). And when these problems co- occur, treatment should
address both (or all), including the use of medications as appropriate.

10. Medically assisted detoxification is only the first stage of addiction treatment and by itself does little to
change long-term drug abuse. Although medically assisted detoxification can safely manage the acute
physical symptoms of withdrawal and can, for some, pave the way for effective long-term addiction
treatment, detoxification alone is rarely sufficient to help addicted individuals achieve long-term
abstinence. Thus, patients should be encouraged to continue drug treatment following detoxification.
Motivational enhancement and incentive strategies, begun at initial patient intake, can improve treatment
engagement.

11. Treatment does not need to be voluntary to be effective. Sanctions or enticements from family,
employment settings, and/or the criminal justice system can significantly increase treatment entry,
retention rates, and the ultimate success of drug treatment interventions.

12. Drug use during treatment must be monitored continuously, as lapses during treatment do occur.
Knowing their drug use is being monitored can be a powerful incentive for patients and can help them
withstand urges to use drugs. Monitoring also provides an early indication of a return to drug use,
signaling a possible need to adjust an individual's treatment plan to better meet his or her needs.

13. Treatment programs should test patients for the presence of HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B and C, tuberculosis,
and other infectious diseases as well as provide targeted risk-reduction counseling, linking patients to
treatment if necessary. Typically, SUD treatment addresses some of the drug-related behaviors that put
people at risk of infectious diseases. Targeted counseling focused on reducing infectious disease risk can
help patients further reduce or avoid substance-related and other high-risk behaviors. Counseling can
also help those who are already infected to manage their illness. Moreover, engaging in SUD treatment
can facilitate adherence to other medical treatments. Substance abuse treatment facilities should provide
onsite, rapid HIV testing rather than referrals to offsite testing—research shows that doing so increases
the likelihood that patients will be tested and receive their test results. Treatment providers should also
inform patients that highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has proven effective in combating HIV,
including among drug-abusing populations, and help link them to HIV treatment if they test positive.

9. Effectively treating substance use disorders in adolescents requires also identifying and treating any
other mental health conditions they may have. Adolescents who abuse drugs frequently also suffer from
other conditions including depression, anxiety disorders, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),
oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct problems. Adolescents who abuse drugs, particularly those
involved in the juvenile justice system, should be screened for other psychiatric disorders. Treatment for
these problems should be integrated with the treatment for a substance use disorder.

10. Sensitive issues such as violence and child abuse or risk of suicide should be identified and addressed.
Many adolescents who abuse drugs have a history of physical, emotional, and/or sexual abuse or other
trauma. If abuse is suspected, referrals should be made to social and protective services, following local
regulations and reporting requirements.

11. It is important to monitor drug use during treatment. Adolescents recovering from substance use
disorders may experience relapse, or a return to drug use. Triggers associated with relapse vary and can
include mental stress and social situations linked with prior drug use. It is important to identify a return
to drug use early before an undetected relapse progresses to more serious consequences. A relapse signals
the need for more treatment or a need to adjust the individual’s current treatment plan to better meet his
or her needs.

12. Staying in treatment for an adequate period of time and continuity of care afterward are important.
The minimal length of drug treatment depends on the type and extent of the adolescent’s problems,
but studies show outcomes are better when a person stays in treatment for 3 months or more. Because
relapses often occur, more than one episode of treatment may be necessary. Many adolescents also
benefit from continuing care following treatment, including drug use monitoring, follow-up visits at
home, and linking the family to other needed services.

13. Testing adolescents for sexually transmitted diseases like HIV, as well as hepatitis B and C, is an
important part of drug treatment. Adolescents who use drugs—whether injecting or non-injecting—are
at an increased risk for diseases that are transmitted sexually as well as through the blood, including HIV
and hepatitis B and C. All drugs of abuse alter judgment and decision making, increasing the likelihood
that an adolescent will engage in unprotected sex and other high-risk behaviors including sharing
contaminated drug injection equipment and unsafe tattooing and body piercing practices—potential
routes of virus transmission. Substance use treatment can reduce this risk both by reducing adolescents’
drug use (and thus keeping them out of situations in which they are not thinking clearly) and by
providing risk-reduction counseling to help them modify or change their high-risk behaviors.
